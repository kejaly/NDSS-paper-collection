TI  - A Key-Driven Framework for Identity-Preserving Face Anonymization
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-729-paper.pdf
AB  - Virtual faces are crucial content in the metaverse. Recently, attempts have been made to generate virtual faces for privacy protection. Nevertheless, these virtual faces either permanently remove the identifiable information or map the original identity into a virtual one, which loses the original identity forever. In this study, we first attempt to address the conflict between privacy and identifiability in virtual faces, where a key-driven face anonymization and authentication recognition (KFAAR) framework is proposed. Concretely, the KFAAR framework consists of a head posture-preserving virtual face generation (HPVFG) module and a key-controllable virtual face authentication (KVFA) module. The HPVFG module uses a user key to project the latent vector of the original face into a virtual one. Then it maps the virtual vectors to obtain an extended encoding, based on which the virtual face is generated. By simultaneously adding a head posture and facial expression correction module, the virtual face has the same head posture and facial expression as the original face. During the authentication, we propose a KVFA module to directly recognize the virtual faces using the correct user key, which can obtain the original identity without exposing the original face image. We also propose a multi-task learning objective to train HPVFG and KVFA. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed HPVFG and KVFA modules, which effectively achieve both facial anonymity and identifiability.

PY  - 2025

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-338-paper.pdf
AB  - Ownership verification is currently the most critical and widely adopted post-hoc method to safeguard model copyright. In general, model owners exploit it to identify whether a given suspicious third-party model is stolen from them by examining whether it has particular properties `inherited' from their released models. Currently, backdoor-based model watermarks are the primary and cutting-edge methods to implant such properties in the released models. However, backdoor-based methods have two fatal drawbacks, including emph{harmfulness} and emph{ambiguity}. The former indicates that they introduce maliciously controllable misclassification behaviors ($i.e.$, backdoor) to the watermarked released models. The latter denotes that malicious users can easily pass the verification by finding other misclassified samples, leading to ownership ambiguity.

TI  - Generating API Parameter Security Rules with LLM for API Misuse Detection
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-465-paper.pdf
AB  - When utilizing library APIs, developers should follow the API security rules to mitigate the risk of API misuse. API Parameter Security Rule (APSR) is a common type of security rule that specifies how API parameters should be safely used and places constraints on their values. Failure to comply with the APSRs can lead to severe security issues, including null pointer dereference and memory corruption. Manually analyzing numerous APIs and their parameters to construct APSRs is labor-intensive and needs to be automated. Existing studies generate APSRs from documentation and code, but the missing information and limited analysis heuristics result in missing APSRs. Due to the superior Large Language Model’s (LLM) capability in code analysis and text generation without predefined heuristics, we attempt to utilize it to address the challenge encountered in API misuse detection. However, directly utilizing LLMs leads to incorrect APSRs which may lead to false bugs in detection, and overly general APSRs that could not generate applicable detection code resulting in many security bugs undiscovered.

AB  - In recent years, a more advanced form of phishing has arisen on Ethereum, surpassing early-stage, simple transaction phishing. This new form, which we refer to as payload-based transaction phishing (PTXPHISH), manipulates smart contract interactions through the execution of malicious payloads to deceive users. PTXPHISH has rapidly emerged as a significant threat, leading to incidents that caused losses exceeding $70 million in 2023 reports. Despite its substantial impact, no previous studies have systematically explored PTXPHISH.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-43-paper.pdf
AB  - Enterprises are increasingly outsourcing network management (e.g., troubleshooting routing issues) to reduce cost and improve efficiency, either by hiring third-party contractors or by outsourcing to third-party vendors. Unfortunately, recent events have shown that this outsourcing model has become a new source of network incidents in customer networks. In this work, we argue that a risk-aware outsourcing approach is needed that enables customers to measure and assess risk transparently and make informed decisions to minimize harm. We first concretely define the notion of risk in the context of outsourced network management and then present an end-to-end framework, called Heimdall, which enables enterprises to assess, monitor, and respond to risk. Heimdall automatically builds a dependency graph to accurately assess the risk of an outsourced task, and uses a fine-grained reference monitor to monitor and mitigate potential risks during operation. Our expert validation results show that Heimdall effectively controls risk for outsourced network operations, resolving 92% of practical issues at the minimal risk level while incurring only a marginal timing overhead of approximately 7%.

AB  - Web tracking harms user privacy. As a result, the
use of tracker detection and blocking tools is a common practice
among Internet users. However, no such tool can be perfect,
and thus there is a trade-off between avoiding breakage (caused
by unintentionally blocking some required functionality) and ne-
glecting to block some trackers. State-of-the-art tools usually rely
on user reports and developer effort to detect breakages, which
can be broadly categorized into two causes: 1) misidentifying
non-trackers as trackers, and 2) blocking mixed trackers which
blend tracking with functional components.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-366-paper.pdf
AB  - As more critical services move onto the web, it has become increasingly important to detect and address vulnerabilities in web applications. These vulnerabilities only occur under specific conditions: when 1) the vulnerable code is executed and 2) the web application is in the required state. If the application is not in the required state, then even if the vulnerable code is executed, the vulnerability may not be triggered. Previous work naively explores the application state by filling every field and triggering every JavaScript event before submitting HTML forms. However, this simplistic approach can fail to satisfy constraints between the web page elements, as well as input format constraints. To address this, we present EvoCrawl, a web crawler that uses evolutionary search to efficiently find different sequences of web interactions. EvoCrawl finds sequences that can successfully submit inputs to web applications and thus explore more code and server-side states than previous approaches. To assess the benefits of EvoCrawl we evaluate it against three state-of-the-art vulnerability scanners on ten web applications. We find that EvoCrawl achieves better code coverage due to its ability to execute code that can only be executed when the application is in a particular state. On average, EvoCrawl achieves a 59% increase in code coverage and successfully submits HTML forms 5x more frequently than the next best tool. By integrating IDOR and XSS vulnerability scanners, we used EvoCrawl to find eight zero-day IDOR and XSS vulnerabilities in WordPress, HotCRP, Kanboard, ImpressCMS, and GitLab.

T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-s298-paper.pdf
AB  - Deep learning models, while achieving remarkable performances across various tasks, are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), wherein adversaries identify if a specific data point was part of the model's training set. This susceptibility raises substantial privacy concerns, especially when models are trained on sensitive datasets. Although various defenses have been proposed, there is still substantial room for improvement in the privacy-utility trade-off. In this work, we introduce a novel defense framework against MIAs by leveraging generative models. The key intuition of our defense is to *remove the differences between member and non-member inputs*, which is exploited by MIAs, by re-generating input samples before feeding them to the target model. Therefore, our defense, called Diffence, works *pre inference*, which is unlike prior defenses that are either training-time (modify the model) or post-inference time (modify the model's output).

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-349-paper.pdf
AB  - To evade existing antivirus software and detection systems, ransomware authors tend to obscure behavior differences with benign programs by imitating them or by weakening malicious behaviors during encryption. Existing defense solutions have limited effects on defending against evasive ransomware. Fortunately, through extensive observation, we find I/O behaviors of evasive ransomware exhibit a unique repetitiveness during encryption. This is rarely observed in benign programs. Besides, the $chi^2$ test and the probability distribution of byte streams can effectively distinguish encrypted files from benignly modified files. Inspired by these, we first propose ERW-Radar, a detection system, to detect evasive ransomware accurately and efficiently. We make three breakthroughs: 1) a contextual emph{Correlation} mechanism to detect malicious behaviors; 2) a fine-grained content emph{Analysis} mechanism to identify encrypted files; and 3) adaptive mechanisms to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show that ERW-Radar detects evasive ransomware with an accuracy of 96.18% while maintaining a FPR of 5.36%. The average overhead of ERW-Radar is 5.09% in CPU utilization and 3.80% in memory utilization.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1086-paper.pdf
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the security implications of HTTP/2 server push and signed HTTP exchange (SXG) on the Same-Origin Policy (SOP), a fundamental web security mechanism designed to prevent cross-origin attacks. We identify a vulnerability introduced by these features, where the traditional strict SOP origin based on URI is undermined by a more permissive HTTP/2 authority based on the SubjectAlternativeName (SAN) list in the TLS certificate. This relaxation of origin constraints, coupled with the prevalent use of shared certificates among unrelated domains, poses significant security risks, allowing attackers to bypass SOP protections. We introduce two novel attack vectors, CrossPUSH and CrossSXG, which enable an off-path attacker to execute a wide range of cross-origin web attacks, including arbitrary cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation, and malicious file downloads, across all domains listed in a shared certificate. Our investigation reveals the practicality and prevalence of these threats, with our measurements uncovering vulnerabilities in widely-used web browsers such as Chrome and Edge, and notable websites including Microsoft. We responsibly disclose our findings to affected vendors and receive acknowledgments from Huawei, Baidu, Microsoft, etc.

AB  - Recent research has shown that bit-flip attacks (BFAs) can manipulate deep neural networks (DNNs) via DRAM Rowhammer exploitations. For high-level DNN models running on deep learning (DL) frameworks like PyTorch, extensive BFAs have been conducted to flip bits in model weights and shown effective. Defenses have also been proposed to guard model weights. Nevertheless, DNNs are increasingly compiled into DNN executables by DL compilers to leverage hardware primitives. These executables manifest new and distinct computation paradigms; we find existing research failing to accurately capture and expose the attack surface of BFAs on DNN executables.

However, not all data streams inherently demand real-time releases, and achieving such releases is challenging due to network latency and processing constraints in practical settings. We delve into the advantages of introducing a delay time in stream releases. Concentrating on the event-level privacy setting, we discover that incorporating a delay can overcome limitations faced by current approaches, thereby unlocking substantial potential for improving accuracy.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-187-paper.pdf
AB  - Many locations, especially in urban areas, are quite noisy with WiFi traffic. In addition to data traffic, WiFi stations send management and control frames that can easily exceed several hundred frames per second just in one small area. These WiFi environments present the opportunity to transmit data through hiding it within the noise components that can be normal parts of benign transmissions.
In this paper, we show how one particular feature of WiFi, the Timing Synchronization Function (TSF), can be exploited to create a fertile and robust channel for embedding secret signals. We take advantage of the fact that there is always some degree of imprecision reflected in time synchronization of WiFi stations.
We present CHAOS, a new covert channel strategy to embed data bits in WiFi beacon frames using unmodified standard WiFi hardware. CHAOS makes use of the noise properties inherent in WiFi in two ways: First, it encodes information in the ordering of beacon frames, taking advantage of the fact that there is no natural or required ordering of beacons. Second, it makes use of a timing channel in the form of the TSF timestamp in management headers, imitating the natural imprecision of timing in real base stations to encode data in a way that is statistically similar to unmodified frames. CHAOS's parameters can be adjusted to configure data rate, the covert channel stability and frame miss rate; using our suggested settings, it is able to robustly broadcast secret data at 520 bits/s. We also show that TSF has substantial potential for further exploitation, sketching a correlation attack that uses it to map clients to base stations.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-915-paper.pdf
AB  - Federated learning collaboratively trains a neural network on a global server, where each local client receives the current global model weights and sends back parameter updates (gradients) based on its local private data.
The process of sending these model updates may leak client's private data information.
Existing gradient inversion attacks can exploit this vulnerability to recover private training instances from a client's gradient vectors. Recently, researchers have proposed advanced gradient inversion techniques that existing defenses struggle to handle effectively.
In this work, we present a novel defense tailored for large neural network models. Our defense capitalizes on the high dimensionality of the model parameters to perturb gradients within a textit{subspace orthogonal} to the original gradient. By leveraging cold posteriors over orthogonal subspaces, our defense implements a refined gradient update mechanism. This enables the selection of an optimal gradient that not only safeguards against gradient inversion attacks but also maintains model utility.
We conduct comprehensive experiments across three different datasets and evaluate our defense against various state-of-the-art attacks and defenses.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-2290-paper.pdf
AB  - The widespread use of mobile apps meets user needs but also raises security concerns. Current security analysis methods often fall short in addressing user concerns as they do not parse app behavior from the user's standpoint, leading to users not fully understanding the risks within the apps and unknowingly exposing themselves to privacy breaches. On one hand, their analysis and results are usually presented at the code level, which may not be comprehensible to users. On the other hand, they neglect to account for the users' perceptions of the app behavior. In this paper, we aim to extract user-related behaviors from apps and explain them to users in a comprehensible natural language form, enabling users to perceive the gap between their expectations and the app's actual behavior, and assess the risks within the inconsistencies independently. Through experiments, our tool emph{InconPreter} is shown to effectively extract inconsistent behaviors from apps and provide accurate and reasonable explanations. InconPreter achieves an inconsistency identification precision of 94.89% on our labeled dataset, and a risk analysis accuracy of 94.56% on widely used Android malware datasets. When applied to real-world (wild) apps, InconPreter identifies 1,664 risky inconsistent behaviors from 413 apps out of 10,878 apps crawled from Google Play, including the leakage of location, SMS, and contact information, as well as unauthorized audio recording, etc., potentially affecting millions of users. Moreover, InconPreter can detect some behaviors that are not identified by previous tools, such as unauthorized location disclosure in various scenarios (e.g. taking photos, chatting, and enabling mobile hotspots, etc.). We conduct a thorough analysis of the discovered behaviors to deepen the understanding of inconsistent behaviors, thereby helping users better manage their privacy and providing insights for privacy design in further app development.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-298-paper.pdf
AB  - Despite the high frequency of vulnerabilities exposed in software, patching these vulnerabilities remains slow and challenging, which leaves a potential attack window. To mitigate this threat, researchers seek temporary solutions to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited or triggered before they are officially patched. However, prior approaches have limited protection scope, often require code modification of the target vulnerable programs, and rely on recent system features. These limitations significantly reduce their usability and practicality.

TI  - UI-CTX: Understanding UI Behaviors with Code Contexts for Mobile Applications
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-238-paper.pdf
AB  - Many mobile apps utilize UI widgets to interact with users and trigger specific operational logic, such as clicking a button to send a message. While UI widgets are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, they can also be misused to perform harmful behaviors that violate user expectations. To address these potential threats, recent studies strive to understand the intentions of UI widgets in mobile apps. However, existing methods either concentrate on the surface-level features of UI widgets, failing to capture their underlying intentions, or involve tedious and faulty information, making it challenging to distill the core intentions. In this paper, we present UI-CTX, which demystifies UI behaviors with a concise and effective representation. For each UI widget, UI-CTX first represents its intentions with a UI Handler Graph (UHG), incorporating the code context behind the widget while eliminating irrelevant information (e.g., unreachable code blocks). Then, UI-CTX performs graph summarization and explores both the structural and semantic information in UHGs to model the core intentions of UI widgets. To systematically evaluate UI-CTX, we extract a series of UI widget behaviors, such as login and search, from a large-scale dataset and conduct extensive experiments. Experimental results show that UI-CTX can effectively represent the intentions of UI widgets and significantly outperforms existing solutions in modeling UI widget behaviors. For example, in the task of classifying UI widget intentions, UHG achieves the highest average F1-score compared to other widget representations (+95.2% and +8.2% compared with permission set and call sequence, respectively) used in state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, by accurately pinpointing the code contexts of widgets, UI-CTX achieves a $mathbf{3.6times}$ improvement in widget intention clustering performance.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-2001-paper.pdf
AB  - Modern software often provides diverse APIs to facilitate development. Certain APIs, when used, can affect variables and require post-handling, such as error checks and resource releases. Developers should adhere to their usage specifications when using these APIs. Failure to do so can cause serious security threats, such as memory corruption and system crashes. Detecting such misuse depends on comprehensive API specifications, as violations of these specifications indicate API misuse. Previous studies have proposed extracting API specifications from various artifacts, including API documentation, usage patterns, and bug patches. However, these artifacts are frequently incomplete or unavailable for many APIs. As a result, the lack of specifications for uncovered APIs causes many false negatives in bug detection.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-276-paper.pdf
AB  - Decompilation aims to recover the source code form of a binary executable. It has many security applications, such as malware analysis, vulnerability detection, and code hardening. A prominent challenge in decompilation is to recover variable names. We propose a novel technique that leverages the strengths of generative models while mitigating model biases. We build a prototype, GenNm, from pre-trained generative models CodeGemma-2B, CodeLlama-7B, and CodeLlama-34B. We finetune GenNm on decompiled functions and teach models to leverage contextual information. GenNm includes names from callers and callees while querying a function, providing rich contextual information within the model's input token limitation. We mitigate model biases by aligning the output distribution of models with symbol preferences of developers. Our results show that GenNm improves the state-of-the-art name recovery precision by 5.6-11.4 percentage points on two commonly used datasets and improves the state-of-the-art by 32% (from 17.3% to 22.8%) in the most challenging setup where ground-truth variable names are not seen in the training dataset.

AB  - Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a collaborative
learning paradigm designed for scenarios where multiple clients
share disjoint features of the same set of data samples. Albeit a
wide range of applications, VFL is faced with privacy leakage
from data reconstruction attacks. These attacks generally fall
into two categories: honest-but-curious (HBC), where adversaries
steal data while adhering to the protocol; and malicious attacks,
where adversaries breach the training protocol for significant
data leakage. While most research has focused on HBC scenarios,
the exploration of malicious attacks remains limited.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-3389-paper.pdf
AB  - Recent advancements in synthetic speech generation, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) models, allow the generation of convincing synthetic voices, often referred to as audio deepfakes. These deepfakes pose a growing threat as adversaries can use them to impersonate individuals, particularly prominent figures, on social media or bypass voice authentication systems, thus having a broad societal impact. The inability of state-of-the-art verification systems to detect voice deepfakes effectively is alarming.
We propose a novel audio deepfake detection method, VoiceRadar, that augments machine learning with physical models to approximate frequency dynamics and oscillations in audio samples. This significantly enhances detection capabilities. VoiceRadar leverages two main physical models: (i) the Doppler effect to understand frequency changes in audio samples and (ii) drumhead vibrations to decompose complex audio signals into component frequencies. VoiceRadar identifies subtle variations, or micro-frequencies, in the audio signals by applying these models. These micro-frequencies are aggregated to compute the observed frequency, capturing the unique signature of the audio. This observed frequency is integrated into the machine learning algorithm’s loss function, enabling the algorithm to recognize distinct patterns that differentiate human-produced audio from AI-generated audio.
We constructed a new diverse dataset to comprehensively evaluate VoiceRadar, featuring samples from leading TTS and VC models. Our results demonstrate that VoiceRadar outperforms existing methods in accurately identifying AI-generated audio samples, showcasing its potential as a robust tool for audio deepfake detection.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1161-paper.pdf
AB  - Vulnerabilities in Android smartphone chipsets have severe consequences, as recent real-world attacks have demonstrated that adversaries can leverage vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate confidential information. Despite the far-reaching impact of such attacks, the lifecycle of chipset vulnerabilities has yet to be investigated, with existing papers primarily investigating vulnerabilities in the Android operating system. This paper provides a comprehensive and empirical study of the current state of smartphone chipset vulnerability management within the Android ecosystem. For the first time, we create a unified knowledge base of 3,676 chipset vulnerabilities affecting 437 chipset models from all four major chipset manufacturers, combined with 6,866 smartphone models. Our analysis revealed that the same vulnerabilities are often included in multiple generations of chipsets, providing novel empirical evidence that vulnerabilities are inherited through multiple chipset generations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the commonly accepted 90-day responsible vulnerability disclosure period is seldom adhered to. We find that a single vulnerability often affects hundreds to thousands of different smartphone models, for which update availability is, as we show, often unclear or heavily delayed. Leveraging the new insights gained from our empirical analysis, we recommend several changes that chipset manufacturers can implement to improve the security posture of their products. At the same time, our knowledge base enables academic researchers to conduct more representative evaluations of smartphone chipsets, accurately assess the impact of vulnerabilities they discover, and identify avenues for future research.

AB  - Fraudsters often use the promise of free goods as a lure for victims who are convinced to complete online tasks but ultimately receive nothing. Despite much work characterizing these "giveaway scams," no human subjects research has investigated how users interact with them or what factors impact victimization. We conducted a scenario-based experiment with a sample of American teenagers (n = 85) and adult crowd workers (n = 205) in order to investigate how users reason about and interact with giveaway scams advertised in YouTube videos and to determine whether teens are more susceptible than adults. We found that most participants recognized the fraudulent nature of the videos, with only 9.2% believing the scam videos offered legitimate deals. Teenagers did not fall victim to the scams more frequently than adults but reported more experience searching for terms that could lead to victimization. This study is among the first to compare the interactions of adult and teenage users with internet fraud and sheds light on an understudied area of social engineering.

AB  - Efficient cloud computing relies on in-process isolation to optimize performance by running workloads within a single process. Without heavy-weight process isolation, memory safety errors pose a significant security threat by allowing an adversary to extract or corrupt the private data of other co-located tenants. Existing in-process isolation mechanisms are not suitable for modern cloud requirements, e.g., MPK’s 16 protection domains are insufficient to isolate thousands of cloud workers per process. Consequently, cloud service providers have a strong need for lightweight in-process isolation on commodity x86 machines.

Although confidential virtual machines (CVMs) function within isolated environments separate from the host, it is important to recognize that users still encounter challenges in maintaining control over the integrity of the code running within the trusted execution environments (TEEs). The presence of a sophisticated operating system (OS) raises the possibility of dynamically creating and executing any code, making user applications within TEEs vulnerable to interference or tampering if the guest OS is compromised.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-301-paper.pdf
AB  - Virtual devices are a large attack surface of hypervisors. Vulnerabilities in virtual devices may enable attackers to jailbreak hypervisors or even endanger co-located virtual machines. While fuzzing has discovered vulnerabilities in virtual devices across both open-source and closed-source hypervisors, the efficiency of these virtual device fuzzers remains limited because they are unaware of the complex behaviors of virtual devices in general. We present Truman, a novel universal fuzzing engine that automatically infers dependencies from open-source OS drivers to construct device behavior models (DBMs) for virtual device fuzzing, regardless of whether target virtual devices are open-source or binaries. The DBM includes inter- and intra-message dependencies and fine-grained state dependency of virtual device messages. Based on the DBM, Truman generates and mutates quality seeds that satisfy the dependencies encoded in the DBM. We evaluate the prototype of Truman on the latest version of hypervisors. In terms of coverage, Truman outperformed start-of-the-art fuzzers for 19/29 QEMU devices and obtained a relative coverage boost of 34% compared to Morphuzz for virtio devices. Additionally, Truman discovered 54 new bugs in QEMU, VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Pro, and Parallels, with 6 CVEs assigned.

AB  - Rust aims to offer full memory safety for programs, a guarantee that untamed C programs do not enjoy. How difficult is it to translate existing C code to Rust? To get a complementary view from that of automatic C to Rust translators, we report on a user study asking humans to translate real-world C programs to Rust. Our participants are able to produce safe Rust translations, whereas state-of-the-art automatic tools are not able to do so. Our analysis highlights that the high-level strategy taken by users departs significantly from those of automatic tools we study. We also find that users often choose zero-cost (static) abstractions for temporal safety, which addresses a predominant component of runtime costs in other full memory safety defenses. User-provided translations showcase a rich landscape of specialized strategies to translate the same C program in different ways to safe Rust, which future automatic translators can consider.

T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-526-paper.pdf
AB  - Video hardware acceleration stacks, which include multiple complex layers that interact with software and hardware components, are designed to increase the efficiency and performance of demanding tasks such as video decoding, encoding, and transformation. Their implementation raises security concerns due to the lack of operational transparency. The complexity of their multi-layered architecture makes automated testing difficult, especially due to the lack of observability in post-silicon testing. In particular, the tests must consider five different layers, including all interoperation components: the applications, the drivers supporting the user space, the kernel, the firmware of the acceleration peripherals, and the hardware itself. The introspectability and visibility of each layer gradually decrease deeper along the stack.

AB  - Use-After-Free (UAF) is one of the most widely spread and severe memory safety issues, attracting lots of research efforts toward its automatic discovery. Existing UAF detection approaches include two major categories: dynamic and static. While dynamic methods like fuzzing can detect UAF issues with high precision, they are inherently limited in code coverage. Static approaches, on the other hand, can usually only discover simple sequential UAF cases, despite that many real-world UAF bugs involve intricate cross-entry control and data flows (e.g., concurrent UAFs). Limited static tools supporting cross-entry UAF detection also suffer from inaccuracy or narrowed scope (e.g., cannot handle complex codebases like the Linux kernel).

In this paper, we introduce IMMERSPY, a novel acoustic side-channel attack that exploits motion sensors in VR devices to extract sensitive speech content from on-device speakers. We analyze two powerful attacker scenarios: informed attacker, where the attacker possesses labeled data about the victim, and uninformed attacker, where no prior victim information is available. We design a Mel-spectrogram CNN-LSTM model to extract digit information (e.g., social security or credit card numbers) by learning the speech-induced vibrations captured by motion sensors. Our experiments show that IMMERSPY detects four consecutive digits with 74% accuracy and 16-digit sequences, such as credit card numbers, with 62% accuracy. Additionally, we leverage Generative AI text-to-speech models in our attack experiments to illustrate how the attackers can create training datasets even without the need to use the victim’s labeled data. Our findings highlight the critical need for security measures in VR domains to mitigate evolving privacy risks. To address this, we introduce a defense technique that emits inaudible tones through the Head-Mounted Display (HMD) speakers, showing its effectiveness in mitigating acoustic side-channel attacks.

AB  - Apple has integrated satellite communication into their latest iPhones, enabling emergency communication, road- side assistance, location sharing with friends, iMessage, and SMS. This technology allows communication when other wireless services are unavailable. However, the use of satellites poses restrictions on bandwidth and delay, making it difficult to use modern communication protocols with their security and privacy guarantees. To overcome these challenges, Apple designed and implemented a proprietary satellite communication protocol to address these limitations. We are the first to successfully reverse-engineer this protocol and analyze its security and privacy properties. In addition, we develop a simulation-based testbed for testing emergency services without causing emergency calls. Our tests reveal protocol and infrastructure design issues. For example, compact protocol messages come at the cost of missing integrity protection and require an internet-based setup phase. We further demonstrate various restriction bypasses, such as misusing location sharing to send arbitrary text messages on old iOS versions, and sending iMessages over satellite from region-locked countries. These bypasses allow us to overcome censorship and operator control of text messaging services.

TI  - SongBsAb: A Dual Prevention Approach against Singing Voice Conversion based Illegal Song Covers
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-747-paper.pdf
AB  - Singing voice conversion (SVC) automates song covers by converting a source singing voice from a source singer into a new singing voice with the same lyrics and melody as the source, but sounds like being covered by the target singer of some given target singing voices. However, it raises serious concerns about copyright and civil right infringements. We propose SongBsAb, the first proactive approach to tackle SVC-based illegal song covers. SongBsAb adds perturbations to singing voices before releasing them, so that when they are used, the process of SVC will be interfered, leading to unexpected singing voices. Perturbations are carefully crafted to (1) provide a dual prevention, i.e., preventing the singing voice from being used as the source and target singing voice in SVC, by proposing a gender-transformation loss and a high/low hierarchy multi-target loss, respectively; and (2) be harmless, i.e., no side-effect on the enjoyment of protected songs, by refining a psychoacoustic model-based loss with the backing track as an additional masker, a unique accompanying element for singing voices compared to ordinary speech voices. We also adopt a frame-level interaction reduction-based loss and encoder ensemble to enhance the transferability of SongBsAb to unknown SVC models. We demonstrate the prevention effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness of SongBsAb on five diverse and promising SVC models, using both English and Chinese datasets, and both objective and human study-based subjective metrics. Our work fosters an emerging research direction for mitigating illegal automated song covers.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-677-paper.pdf
AB  - Despite the popularity and many convenient features of Amazon Alexa, concerns about privacy risks to users are rising since many Alexa voice-apps (called skills) may collect user data during the interaction with Alexa devices. Informing users about data collection in skills is essential for addressing their privacy concerns. However, the constrained interfaces of Alexa pose a challenge to effective privacy notices, where currently Alexa users can only access privacy policies of skills over the Web or smartphone apps. This in particular creates a challenge for visually impaired users to make informed privacy decisions. In this work, we propose the concept of Privacy Notice over Voice, an accessible and inclusive mechanism to make users aware of the data practices of Alexa skills through the conversational interface: for each skill, we will generate a short and easily understandable privacy notice and play it to users at the beginning of the skill in voice. We first conduct a user study involving 52 smart speaker users and 21 Alexa skill developers to understand their attitudes toward data collection and the Privacy Notice over Voice mechanism. 92.3% of participants liked the design of Privacy Notice over Voice and 70.2% of participants agreed that such mechanism provides better accessibility and readability than traditional privacy policies for Alexa users. Informed by our user study results, we design and develop a tool named SKILLPoV (Skill’s Privacy Notice over Voice) to automatically generate a reference implementation of Privacy Notice over Voice through static code analysis and instrumentation. With comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SKILLPoV in capturing data collection (91.3% accuracy and 96.4% completeness) from skill code, generating concise and accurate privacy notice content using ChatGPT, and instrumenting skill code with the new privacy notice mechanism without altering the original functionality. In particular, SKILLPoV receives positive and encouraging feedback after real-world testing conducted by skill developers.

AB  - Intelligent Network Data Plane (INDP) is emerging as a promising direction for in-network security due to the advancement of machine learning technologies and the importance of fast mitigation of attacks. However, the feature extraction function still poses various challenges due to multiple hardware constraints in the data plane, especially for the advanced per-flow 3rd-order features (e.g., inter-packet delay and packet size distributions) preferred by recent security applications. In this paper, we discover novel attack surfaces of state-of-the-art data plane feature extractors that had to accommodate the hardware constraints, allowing adversaries to evade the entire attack detection loop of in-network intrusion detection systems. To eliminate the attack surfaces fundamentally, we pursue an evolution of a probabilistic (sketch) approach to enable flawless 3rd-order feature extraction, highlighting High-resolution, All-flow, and Full-range (HAF) 3rd-order feature measurement capacity. To our best knowledge, the proposed scheme, namely SketchFeature, is the first sketch-based 3rd-order feature extractor fully deployable in the data plane. Through extensive analyses, we confirmed the robust performance of SketchFeature theoretically and experimentally. Furthermore, we ran various security use cases, namely covert channel, botnet, and DDoS detections, with SketchFeature as a feature extractor, and achieved near-optimal attack detection performance.

This limits the applications of zkSNARKs, such as private payments, private smart contracts, and anonymous credentials. Private delegation has become a prominent way to accelerate proof generation.

AB  - The Windows operating system employs various inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, typically involving a privileged server and a less privileged client. However, scenarios exist where the client has higher privileges, such as a performance monitor running as a domain controller obtaining data from a domain member via IPC. In these cases, the server can be compromised and send crafted data to the client.
Despite the increase in Windows client applications, existing research has overlooked potential client-side vulnerabilities, which can be equally harmful. This paper introduces GLEIPNIR, the first vulnerability detection tool for Windows remote IPC clients. GLEIPNIR identifies client-side vulnerabilities by fuzzing IPC call return values and introduces a snapshot technology to enhance testing efficiency. Experiments on 76 client applications demonstrate that GLEIPNIR can identify 25 vulnerabilities within 7 days, resulting in 14 CVEs and a bounty of $36,000.

The broadcast nature of radio signal propagation makes such attacks possible in the first place, but at the same time poses a challenge for the attacker: The jamming signal does not only reach the victim device but also other neighboring devices, preventing precise attack targeting.

AB  - Adoption of transformer-based machine learning models is growing, raising concerns about sensitive data exposure. Nonetheless, current secure inference solutions incur substantial overhead due to their extensive reliance on non-linear protocols, such as softmax and Gaussian error linear unit (GELU). Driven by numerical stability needs, softmax approximations (e.g., NeurIPS 2021) typically extract the maximum element of an input vector, incurring logarithmic rounds (in the input length). Existing GELU protocols (e.g., S&P 2024) use piecewise approximations with high-degree polynomials that rely heavily on secure multiplications and comparisons, which are expensive. Such complexities also hinder model owners who are not familiar with cryptography from easily deploying their custom models.

AB  - Secure inference is designed to enable encrypted machine learning model prediction over encrypted data. It will ease privacy concerns when models are deployed in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). For efficiency, most of recent secure inference protocols are constructed using secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques. They can ensure that MLaaS computes inference without knowing the inputs of users and model owners. However, MPC-based protocols do not hide information revealed from their output. In the context of secure inference, prediction outputs (i.e., inference results of encrypted user inputs) are revealed to the users. As a result, adversaries can compromise textbf{output privacy} of secure inference, i.e., launching Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by querying encrypted models, just like MIAs in plaintext inference.

AB  - Cloud based Spark platform is a tempting approach for sharing data, as it allows data users to easily analyze the data while the owners to efficiently share the large volume of data. However, the absence of a robust policy enforcement mechanism on Spark hinders the data owners from sharing their data due to the risk of private data breach. In this respect, we found that malicious data users and cloud managers can easily leak the data by constructing a policy violating physical plan, compromising the Spark libraries, or even compromising the Spark cluster itself. Nonetheless, current approaches fail to securely and generally enforce the policies on Spark, as they do not check the policies on physical plan level, and they do not protect the integrity of data analysis pipeline.

While these updates typically help with restricting app access to storage through various mechanisms, they may occasionally introduce new complexities and vulnerabilities. A prime example is the introduction of scoped storage in Android 10, which fundamentally changed how apps interact with files. While intended to enhance user privacy by limiting broad access to shared storage, scoped storage has also presented developers with new challenges and potential vulnerabilities to address. However, despite its significance for user privacy and app functionality, no systematic studies have been performed to study Android's scoped storage at depth from a security perspective.

AB  - Split Learning (SL) is a distributed deep learning approach enabling multiple clients and a server to collaboratively train and infer on a shared deep neural network (DNN) without requiring clients to share their private local data. The DNN is partitioned in SL, with most layers residing on the server and a few initial layers and inputs on the client side. This configuration allows resource-constrained clients to participate in training and inference. However, the distributed architecture exposes SL to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients can manipulate local datasets to alter the DNN's behavior. Existing defenses from other distributed frameworks like Federated Learning are not applicable, and there is a lack of effective backdoor defenses specifically designed for SL.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1089-paper.pdf
AB  - The safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to prevent unsafe content that violates human values.
To ensure this, it is essential to evaluate the robustness of their alignment against diverse malicious attacks.
However, the lack of a large-scale, unified measurement framework hinders a comprehensive understanding of potential vulnerabilities.
To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of existing and newly proposed safety misalignment methods for LLMs. Specifically, we investigate four research questions: (1) evaluating the robustness of LLMs with different alignment strategies, (2) identifying the most effective misalignment method, (3) determining key factors that influence misalignment effectiveness, and (4) exploring various defenses.
The safety misalignment attacks in our paper include system-prompt modification, model fine-tuning, and model editing.
Our findings show that Supervised Fine-Tuning is the most potent attack but requires harmful model responses.
In contrast, our novel Self-Supervised Representation Attack (SSRA) achieves significant misalignment without harmful responses.
We also examine defensive mechanisms such as safety data filter, model detoxification, and our proposed Self-Supervised Representation Defense (SSRD), demonstrating that SSRD can effectively re-align the model.
In conclusion, our unified safety alignment evaluation framework empirically highlights the fragility of the safety alignment of LLMs.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-830-paper.pdf
AB  - In applying deep learning for malware classification, it is crucial to account for the prevalence of malware evolution, which can cause trained classifiers to fail on drifted malware. Existing solutions to address concept drift use active learning. They select new samples for analysts to label and then retrain the classifier with the new labels. Our key finding is that the current retraining techniques do not achieve optimal results. These techniques overlook that updating the model with scarce drifted samples requires learning features that remain consistent across pre-drift and post-drift data. The model should thus be able to disregard specific features that, while beneficial for the classification of pre-drift data, are absent in post-drift data, thereby preventing prediction degradation. In this paper, we propose a new technique for detecting and classifying drifted malware that learns drift-invariant features in malware control flow graphs by leveraging graph neural networks with adversarial domain adaptation.  We compare it with existing model retraining methods in active learning-based malware detection systems and other domain adaptation techniques from the vision domain. Our approach significantly improves drifted malware detection on publicly available benchmarks and real-world malware databases reported daily by security companies in 2024.  We also tested our approach in predicting multiple malware families drifted over time. A thorough evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

Among these, just-in-time return-oriented programming (JIT-ROP) stands out as an advanced form of code-reuse attack designed to circumvent code randomization defenses. JIT-ROP leverages memory disclosure vulnerabilities to dynamically harvest reusable code gadgets and construct attack payloads in real-time. To counteract JIT-ROP threats, researchers have developed multiple execute-only memory (XoM) prototypes to prevent dynamic reading and disassembly of memory pages. XoM, akin to the widely deployed W$oplus$X protection, holds promise in enhancing security. However, existing XoM solutions may not be compatible with legacy and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) programs, or they may require patching the protected binary to separate code and data areas, leading to poor reliability. In addition, some XoM methods have to modify the underlying architectural mechanism, compromising compatibility and performance.

AB  - While neural networks (NNs) are traditionally associated with tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing, this paper presents a novel application of NNs for efficient cryptographic computations. Leveraging the Turing completeness and inherent adaptability of NN models, we propose a transformative approach that efficiently accelerates cryptographic computations on various platforms. More specifically, with a program translation framework that converts traditional cryptographic algorithms into NN models, our proof-of-concept implementations in TensorFlow demonstrate substantial performance improvements: encryption speeds for AES, Chacha20, and Salsa20 show increases of up to 4.09$times$, 5.44$times$, and 5.06$times$, respectively, compared to existing GPU-based cryptographic solutions written by human experts. These enhancements are achieved without compromising the security of the original cryptographic algorithms, ensuring that our neural network-based approach maintains robust security standards. This repurposing of NNs opens new pathways for the development of scalable, efficient, and secure cryptographic systems that can adapt to the evolving
demands of modern computing environments.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-365-paper.pdf
AB  - A Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol is a cryptographic method allowing two parties, each with a private set, to determine the intersection of their sets without revealing any information about their entries except for the intersection itself. While extensive research has focused on PSI protocols, most studies have centered on scenarios where two parties possess sets of similar sizes, assuming a semi-honest threat model.
However, when the sizes of the parties' sets differ significantly, a generalized solution tends to underperform compared to a specialized one, as recent research has demonstrated. Additionally, conventional PSI protocols are typically designed for a single execution, requiring the entire protocol to be re-executed for each set intersection. This approach is suboptimal for applications such as URL denylisting and email filtering, which may involve multiple set intersections of small sets against a large set (e.g., one for each email received).
In this study, we propose a novel PSI protocol optimized for the recurrent setting where parties have unbalanced set sizes. We implement our protocol using Levelled Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Cuckoo hashing, and introduce several optimizations to ensure real-time performance. By utilizing the Microsoft SEAL library, we demonstrate that our protocol can perform private set intersections in 20 ms and 240 ms on 10 Gbps and 100 Mbps networks, respectively.
Compared to existing solutions, our protocol offers significant improvements, reducing set intersection times by one order of magnitude on slower networks and by two orders of magnitude on faster networks.

AB  - Containers have become widely adopted in cloud platforms due to their efficient deployment and high resource utilization. However, their weak isolation has always posed a significant security concern. In this paper, we propose RContainer, a novel secure container architecture that protects containers from untrusted operating systems and enforces strong isolation among containers by extending ARM Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) hardware primitives. RContainer introduces a small, trusted mini-OS that runs alongside the deprivileged OS, responsible for monitoring the control flow between the operating system and containers. Additionally, RContainer uses shim-style isolation, creating an isolated physical address space called con-shim for each container at the kernel layer through the Granule Protection Check mechanism. We have implemented RContainer on ARMv9-A Fixed Virtual Platform and ARMv8 hardware SoC for security analysis and performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that RContainer can significantly enhance container security with a modest performance overhead and a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).

PY  - 2025

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-363-paper.pdf
AB  - Federated learning has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution for machine learning domains that rely on user interactions, particularly recommender systems and online learning to rank. While there has been substantial research on the privacy of traditional federated learning, little attention has been paid to the privacy properties of these interaction-based settings. In this work, we show that users face an elevated risk of having their private interactions reconstructed by the central server when the server can control the training features of the items that users interact with. We introduce RAIFLE, a novel optimization-based attack framework where the server actively manipulates the features of the items presented to users to increase the success rate of reconstruction. Our experiments with federated recommendation and online learning-to-rank scenarios demonstrate that RAIFLE is significantly more powerful than existing reconstruction attacks like gradient inversion, achieving high performance consistently in most settings. We discuss the pros and cons of several possible countermeasures to defend against RAIFLE in the context of interaction-based federated learning.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1244-paper.pdf
AB  - Software-Defined Networking (SDN) improves network flexibility by decoupling control functions (control plane) from forwarding devices (data plane). However, the logically centralized control plane is vulnerable to Control Policy Manipulation (CPM), which introduces incorrect policies by manipulating the controller's network view. Current methods for anomaly detection and configuration verification have limitations in detecting CPM attacks because they focus solely on the data plane. Certain covert CPM attacks are indistinguishable from normal behavior without analyzing the causality of the controller's decisions. In this paper, we propose ProvGuard, a provenance graph-based detection framework that identifies CPM attacks by monitoring controller activities. ProvGuard leverages static analysis to identify data-plane-related controller operations and guide controller instrumentation, constructing a provenance graph from captured control plane activities. ProvGuard reduces redundancies and extracts paths in the provenance graph as contexts to capture concise and long-term features. Suspicious behaviors are flagged by identifying paths that cause prediction errors beyond the normal range, based on a sequence-to-sequence prediction model. We implemented a prototype of ProvGuard on the Floodlight controller. Our approach successfully identified all four typical CPM attacks that previous methods could not fully address and provided valuable insights for investigating attack behaviors.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-886-paper.pdf
AB  - The exploitation of publicly accessible data has led to escalating concerns regarding data privacy and intellectual property (IP) breaches in the age of artificial intelligence. To safeguard both data privacy and IP-related domain knowledge, efforts have been undertaken to render shared data unlearnable for unauthorized models in the wild. Existing methods apply empirically optimized perturbations to the data in the hope of disrupting the correlation between the inputs and the corresponding labels such that the data samples are converted into Unlearnable Examples (UEs). Nevertheless, the absence of mechanisms to verify the robustness of UEs against uncertainty in unauthorized models and their training procedures engenders several under-explored challenges. First, it is hard to quantify the unlearnability of UEs against unauthorized adversaries from different runs of training, leaving the soundness of the defense in obscurity. Particularly, as a prevailing evaluation metric, empirical test accuracy faces generalization errors and may not plausibly represent the quality of UEs. This also leaves room for attackers, as there is no rigid guarantee of the maximal test accuracy achievable by attackers. Furthermore, we find that a simple recovery attack can restore the clean-task performance of the classifiers trained on UEs by slightly perturbing the learned weights. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we propose a mechanism for certifying the so-called $(q, eta)$-Learnability of an unlearnable dataset via parametric smoothing. A lower certified $(q, eta)$-Learnability indicates a more robust and effective protection over the dataset. Concretely, we 1) improve the tightness of certified $(q, eta)$-Learnability and 2) design Provably Unlearnable Examples (PUEs) which have reduced $(q, eta)$-Learnability. According to experimental results, PUEs demonstrate both decreased certified $(q, eta)$-Learnability and enhanced empirical robustness compared to existing UEs. Compared to the competitors on classifiers with uncertainty in parameters, PUEs reduce at most $18.9%$ of certified $(q, eta)$-Learnability on ImageNet and $54.4%$ of the empirical test accuracy score on CIFAR-100.

AB  - Fuzzing evolved into the most popular technique to detect bugs in software. Its combination with sanitizers has shown tremendous efficacy in uncovering memory safety errors, such as buffer overflows, that haunt C and C++ programmers. However, an important class of such issues, the so-called use-of-uninitialized-memory (UUM) errors, struggles to gain similar benefits from fuzzing endeavors. The only fuzzer-compatible UUM sanitizer available to date, MSan, requires that all libraries are fully instrumented. Unlike address sanitization, for which partial instrumentation results in false negatives (missed detection of bugs), UUM sanitizers require complete instrumentation to avoid false positives, hampering testing at scale. Yet, full-stack compiler-based instrumentation can be a daunting prospect for compatibility and practicality. As a result, many programs are left untested for UUM bugs.

AB  - Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients' data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients' datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.62% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95% reduction in running time while varying the duplication level between 10% and 30%. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-928-paper.pdf
AB  - Adapting pre-trained deep learning models to customized tasks has become a popular choice for developers to cope with limited computational resources and data volume. More specifically, probing--training a classifier on a pre-trained encoder--has been widely adopted in transfer learning, which helps to prevent overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. However, such generalizability of pre-trained encoders raises concerns about the potential misuse of probing for harmful applications, such as discriminatory speculation and warfare applications. In this work, we introduce EncoderLock, a novel applicability authorization method designed to protect pre-trained encoders from malicious probing, i.e., yielding poor performance on specified prohibited domains while maintaining their utility in authorized ones. Achieving this balance is challenging because of the opposite optimization objectives and the variety of downstream heads that adversaries can utilize adaptively. To address these challenges, EncoderLock employs two techniques: domain-aware weight selection and updating to restrict applications on prohibited domains/tasks, and self-challenging training scheme that iteratively strengthens resistance against any potential downstream classifiers that adversaries may apply. Moreover, recognizing the potential lack of data from prohibited domains in practical scenarios, we introduce three EncoderLock variants with different levels of data accessibility: supervised (prohibited domain data with labels), unsupervised (prohibited domain data without labels), and zero-shot (no data or labels available). Extensive experiments across fifteen domains and three model architectures demonstrate EncoderLock's effectiveness over baseline methods using non-transferable learning. Additionally, we verify EncoderLock's effectiveness and practicality with a real-world pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder from Facebook. These results underscore the valuable contributions EncoderLock brings to the development of responsible AI.

AB  - Previous works have shown that Bluetooth is susceptible to so-called Method Confusion attacks. These attacks manipulate devices into conducting conflicting key establishment methods, leading to compromised keys. An increasing amount of security-sensitive applications, like payment terminals, organizational asset tracking systems and conferencing technologies now rely on the availability of a technology like Bluetooth.
It is thus an urgent goal to find and validate a mitigation to these attacks or to provide an appropriate replacement for Bluetooth without introducing additional requirements
that exclude device or user groups.
Despite recent solution proposals, existing threat models overlook certain attack vectors or dismiss important scenarios and consequently suffer under new variants of Method Confusion.

AB  - The effectiveness of natural language privacy policies continues to be clouded by concerns surrounding their readability, ambiguity, and accessibility. Despite multiple design alternatives proposed over the years, natural language policies are still the primary format for organizations to communicate privacy practices to users. Current NLP techniques are often drawn towards generating high-level overviews, or specialized towards a single aspect of consumer privacy communication; the flexibility to apply them for multiple tasks is missing. To this aid, we present PolicyPulse, an information extraction pipeline designed to process privacy policies into usable formats. PolicyPulse employs a specialized XLNet classifier, and leverages a BERT-based model for semantic role labeling to extract phrases from policy sentences, while maintaining the semantic relations between predicates and their arguments. Our classification model was trained on 13,946 manually annotated semantic frames, and achieves a F1-score of 0.97 on identifying privacy practices communicated using clauses within a sentence. We emphasize the versatility of PolicyPulse through prototype applications to support requirement-driven policy presentations, question-answering systems, and privacy preference checking.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-603-paper.pdf
AB  - In recent years, the rise of machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity has brought new challenges, including the increasing threat of backdoor poisoning attacks on ML malware classifiers. These attacks aim to manipulate model behavior when provided with a particular input trigger. For instance, adversaries could inject malicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training data and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current countermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging disagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on training data points.
However, these methods are not applicable in scenarios involving ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) or for users who seek to purify a backdoored model post-training. Addressing this scenario, we introduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates various types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor embedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on the activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the trigger-embedding method.
In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation distribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By regulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a backdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates substantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by experiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack configurations. Our experiments showcase that PBP can mitigate even the SOTA backdoor attacks for malware classifiers, e.g., Jigsaw Puzzle, which was previously demonstrated to be stealthy against existing backdoor defenses. Notably, your approach requires only a small portion of the training data --- only 1% --- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack success rate from 100% to almost 0%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/judydnguyen/pbp-backdoor-purification-official.

AB  - We introduce Mysticeti-C, the first DAG-based Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve the lower bounds of latency of 3 message rounds.
Since Mysticeti-C is built over DAGs it also achieves high resource efficiency and censorship resistance. Mysticeti-C achieves this latency improvement by avoiding explicit certification of the DAG blocks and by proposing a novel commit rule such that every block can be committed without delays, resulting in optimal latency in the steady state and under crash failures. We further extend Mysticeti-C to Mysticeti-FPC, which incorporates a fast commit path that achieves even lower latency for transferring assets. Unlike prior fast commit path protocols, Mysticeti-FPC minimizes the number of signatures and messages by weaving the fast path transactions into the DAG. This frees up resources, which subsequently result in better performance. We prove the safety and liveness in a Byzantine context. We evaluate both Mysticeti protocols and compare them with state-of-the-art consensus and fast path protocols to demonstrate their low latency and resource efficiency, as well as their more graceful degradation under crash failures. Mysticeti-C is the first Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve WAN latency of 0.5s for consensus commit while simultaneously maintaining state-of-the-art throughput of over 100k TPS. Finally, we report on integrating Mysticeti-C as the consensus protocol into a major deployed blockchain, resulting in over 4x latency reduction.

AB  - The fast-paced development and deployment of private messaging applications demands mechanisms to protect against the concomitant potential for abuse. While widely used end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging systems have deployed mechanisms for users to verifiably report abusive messages without compromising the privacy of unreported messages, abuse reporting schemes for systems that additionally protect message metadata are still in their infancy. Existing solutions either focus on a relatively small portion of the design space or incur much higher communication and computation costs than their E2EE brethren.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are increasingly employed in numerous applications across various areas. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the security of interactions between users and VR devices. In this paper, we disclose a new side-channel leakage in the constellation tracking system of mainstream VR platforms, where the infrared (IR) signals emitted from the VR controllers for controller-headset interactions can be maliciously exploited to reconstruct unconstrained input keystrokes on the virtual keyboard non-intrusively. We propose a novel keystroke inference attack named VRecKey to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of this novel infrared side channel. Specifically, VRecKey leverages a customized 2D IR sensor array to intercept ambient IR signals emitted from VR controllers and subsequently infers (i) character-level key presses on the virtual keyboard and (ii) word-level keystrokes along with their typing trajectories. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of VRecKey with two commercial VR devices, and the results indicate that it can achieve over 94.2% and 90.5% top-3 accuracy in inferring character-level and word-level keystrokes with varying lengths, respectively. In addition, empirical results show that VRecKey is resilient to several practical impact factors and presents effectiveness in various real-world scenarios, which provides a complementary and orthogonal attack surface for the exploration of keystroke inference attacks in VR platforms.

AB  - In recent years a new class of side-channel attacks has emerged. Instead of targeting device emissions during dynamic computation, adversaries now frequently exploit the leakage or response behaviour of integrated circuits in a static state. Members of this class include Static Power Side-Channel Analysis (SCA), Laser Logic State Imaging (LLSI) and Impedance Analysis (IA). Despite relying on different physical phenomena, they all enable the extraction of sensitive information from circuits in a static state with high accuracy and low noise -- a trait that poses a significant threat to many established side-channel countermeasures.

TI  - MingledPie: A Cluster Mingling Approach for Mitigating Preference Profiling in CFL
PY  - 2025

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-195-paper.pdf
AB  - Clustered federated learning (CFL) serves as a promising framework to address the challenges of non-IID (non-Independent and Identically Distributed) data and heterogeneity in federated learning. It involves grouping clients into clusters based on the similarity of their data distributions or model updates. However, classic CFL frameworks pose severe threats to clients' privacy since the honest-but-curious server can easily know the bias of clients' data distributions (its preferences). In this work, we propose a privacy-enhanced clustered federated learning framework, MingledPie, aiming to resist against servers' preference profiling capabilities by allowing clients to be grouped into multiple clusters spontaneously. Specifically, within a given cluster, we mingled two types of clients in which a major type of clients share similar data distributions while a small portion of them do not (false positive clients). Such that, the CFL server fails to link clients' data preferences based on their belonged cluster categories. To achieve this, we design an indistinguishable cluster identity generation approach to enable clients to form clusters with a certain proportion of false positive members without the assistance of a CFL server.  Meanwhile, training with mingled false positive clients will inevitably degrade the performances of the cluster's global model. To rebuild an accurate cluster model, we represent the mingled cluster models as a system of linear equations consisting of the accurate models and solve it. Rigid theoretical analyses are conducted to evaluate the usability and security of the proposed designs. In addition, extensive evaluations of MingledPie on six open-sourced datasets show that it defends against preference profiling attacks with an accuracy of 69.4% on average. Besides, the model accuracy loss is limited to between 0.02% and 3.00%.

AB  - The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the ability to effectively analyze and generate code nearly instantaneously, resulting in their widespread adoption in software development. Following this advancement, researchers and companies have also begun integrating LLMs across the hardware design and verification process. However, these highly potent LLMs can also induce new attack scenarios upon security vulnerabilities across the hardware development process. One such attack vector that has not been explored so far is intellectual property (IP) piracy. Given that this attack can manifest as rewriting hardware designs to evade piracy detection, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate LLM capabilities in performing this task and assess the mitigation abilities of current IP piracy detection tools.

AB  - Fluorescent lamps are almost everywhere for electric lighting in daily life, across private and public scenarios. Our study uncovers a new electromagnetic interference (EMI) attack surface that these light sources are actually able to manipulate nearby IoT devices in a contactless way. Different from previous EMI attempts requiring a specialized metal antenna as the emission source, which can easily alert victims, we introduce LightAntenna that leverages unaltered everyday fluorescent lamps to launch concealed EMI attacks. To understand why and how fluorescent lamps can be exploited as malicious antennas, we systematically characterize the rationale of EMI emission from fluorescent lamps and identify their capabilities and limits in terms of intensity and frequency response. Moreover, we carefully design a covert method of injecting high-frequency signals into the fluorescent tube via power line transmission. In this way, LightAntenna can realize controllable EMI attacks even across rooms and at a distance of up to 20 m. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the generality, practicality, tunability, and remote attack capability of LightAntenna, which successfully interferes with various types of sensors and IoT devices. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the LightAntenna mechanism and proposes defensive strategies to mitigate this emerging attack surface.

TI  - LADDER: Multi-Objective Backdoor Attack via Evolutionary Algorithm
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1061-paper.pdf
AB  - Current black-box backdoor attacks in convolutional neural networks formulate attack objective(s) as textit{single-objective} optimization problems in textit{single domain}.
Designing triggers in single domain harms semantics and trigger robustness as well as introduces visual and spectral anomaly.
This work proposes a multi-objective black-box backdoor attack in dual domains via evolutionary algorithm (LADDER), the first instance of achieving multiple attack objectives simultaneously by optimizing triggers without requiring prior knowledge about victim model.
In particular, we formulate LADDER as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) and solve it via multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA).
MOEA maintains a population of triggers with trade-offs among attack objectives and uses non-dominated sort to drive triggers toward optimal solutions.
We further apply preference-based selection to MOEA to exclude impractical triggers.
LADDER investigates a new dual-domain perspective for trigger stealthiness by minimizing the anomaly between clean and poisoned samples in the spectral domain.
Lastly, the robustness against preprocessing operations is achieved by pushing triggers to low-frequency regions.
Extensive experiments comprehensively showcase that LADDER achieves attack effectiveness of at least 99%, attack robustness with 90.23% (50.09% higher than state-of-the-art attacks on average), superior natural stealthiness (1.12$times$ to 196.74$times$ improvement) and excellent spectral stealthiness (8.45$times$ enhancement) as compared to current stealthy attacks by the average $l_2$-norm across 5 public datasets.

AB  - The sharing of hardware elements, such as caches, is known to introduce microarchitectural side-channel leakage. One approach to eliminate this leakage is to not share hardware elements across security domains. However, even under the assumption of leakage-free hardware, it is unclear whether other critical system components, like the operating system, introduce software-caused side-channel leakage.

AB  - In recent years, the proliferation of WiFi-connected devices and related research has led to novel techniques of utilizing WiFi as sensors, i.e., capturing human movements through channel state information (CSI) perturbations. While this enables passive occupant sensing, it also introduces privacy risks from textit{leaked WiFi signals} that attackers can intercept, leading to threats like textit{occupancy detection}, critical in scenarios such as burglaries or stalking. We propose LeakyBeam, a novel and improved textit{occupancy detection attack} that leverages a new side channel from WiFi CSI, namely beamforming feedback information (BFI). BFI retains victim's movement information, even when transmitted through walls, and is easily captured since BFI packets are unencrypted, making them a rich source of privacy-sensitive information. Furthermore, we also introduce a defense mechanism that obfuscates BFI packets, requiring minimal hardware changes. We demonstrate LeakyBeam's effectiveness through a comprehensive real-world evaluation at a distance of 20 meters, achieving true positive and negative rates of 82.7% and 96.7%, respectively.

AB  - The vision-based perception modules in autonomous vehicles (AVs) are prone to physical adversarial patch attacks. However, most existing attacks indiscriminately affect all passing vehicles. This paper introduces L-HAWK, a novel controllable physical adversarial patch activated by long-distance laser signals. L-HAWK is designed to target specific vehicles when the adversarial patch is triggered by laser signals while remaining benign under normal conditions. To achieve this goal and address the unique challenges associated with laser signals, we propose an asynchronous learning method for L-HAWK to determine the optimal laser parameters and the corresponding adversarial patch. To enhance the attack robustness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a multi-angle and multi-position simulation mechanism, a noise approximation approach, and a progressive sampling-based method. L-HAWK has been validated through extensive experiments in both digital and physical environments. Compared to a 59% success rate of TPatch (Usenix ’23) at 7 meters, L-HAWK achieves a 91.9% average attack success rate at 50 meters. This represents a 56% improvement in attack success rate and a more than sevenfold increase in attack distance.

AB  - Abstract—A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed inventory that lists the dependencies that make up a software product. Accurate, complete, and up-to-date SBOMs are essential for vulnerability management, reducing license compliance risks, and maintaining high software integrity. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NTIA) has established minimum requirements for SBOMs to comply with, especially the correctness and completeness of listed dependencies in SBOMs. However, these requirements remain unexamined in practice. This paper presents the first systematic study on the landscape of SBOMs, including their prevalence, release trends, and characteristics in the Java ecosystem. We developed an end-to-end tool to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of dependencies in SBOMs. Our tool analyzed 25,882 SBOMs and associated JAR files, identifying that 7,907 SBOMs failed to disclose direct dependencies, highlighting the prevalence and severity of SBOM noncompliance issues. Furthermore, 4.97% of these omitted dependencies were vulnerable, leaving software susceptible to potential exploits. Through detailed measurement studies and analysis of root causes, this research uncovers significant security implications of non-compliant SBOMs, especially concerning vulnerability management. These findings, crucial for enhancing SBOM compliance assurance, are being responsibly reported to relevant stakeholders.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) extended as systems, such as ChatGPT, have begun supporting third-party applications. These LLM apps leverage the de facto natural language-based automated execution paradigm of LLMs: that is, apps and their interactions are defined in natural language, provided access to user data, and allowed to freely interact with each other and the system. These LLM app ecosystems resemble the settings of earlier computing platforms, where there was insufficient isolation between apps and the system. Because third-party apps may not be trustworthy, and exacerbated by the imprecision of natural language interfaces, the current designs pose security and privacy risks for users. In this paper, we evaluate whether these issues can be addressed through execution isolation and what that isolation might look like in the context of LLM-based systems, where there are arbitrary natural language-based interactions between system components, between LLM and apps, and between apps. To that end, we propose IsolateGPT, a design architecture that demonstrates the feasibility of execution isolation and provides a blueprint for implementing isolation, in LLM-based systems. We evaluate IsolateGPT against a number of attacks and demonstrate that it protects against many security, privacy, and safety issues that exist in non-isolated LLM-based systems, without any loss of functionality. The performance overhead incurred by IsolateGPT to improve security is under 30% for three-quarters of tested queries.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1156-paper.pdf
AB  - Mixnets are a type of anonymous communication system designed to provide network privacy to users. They route client messages through multiple hops, with each hop (mix)
perturbing the traffic patterns, thus making message tracing difficult for a network adversary. However, privacy in mixnets comes at the cost of increased latency, limiting the applications
that are usable when accessed through a mixnet. In this work we present LAMP, a set of routing approaches tailored for minimizing the propagation latency in mixnets with minimal
impact on anonymity. The design of these approaches is grounded in practical deployment considerations making them lightweight, easy to integrate with existing deployed mixnets and computationally realistic. We evaluate the proposed approaches using latency data from the deployed Nym mixnet and demonstrate that LAMP can reduce latency by a factor of 7.5 (from 153.4ms to 20ms) while maintaining high anonymity. LAMP even outperforms the
state-of-the-art system LARMix, providing 3× better latency-anonymity tradeoffs and significantly reducing the computational overhead by ≈ 13900× in comparison to LARMix.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-392-paper.pdf
AB  - In structured peer-to-peer networks, like Chord, users find data by
asking a number of intermediate nodes in the network. Each node
provides the identity of the closet known node to the address of the
data, until eventually the node responsible for the data is reached.
This structure means that the intermediate nodes learn the address of
the sought after data. Revealing this information to other nodes makes
Chord unsuitable for applications that require query privacy so in
this paper we present a scheme Iris to provide query privacy while
maintaining compatibility with the existing Chord protocol. This means
that anyone using it will be able to execute a privacy preserving
query but it does not require other nodes in the network to use it (or
even know about it).

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-36-paper.pdf
AB  - Autonomous driving systems (ADS) heavily depend on multi-sensor fusion (MSF) perception systems to process sensor data and improve the accuracy of environmental perception. However, MSF cannot completely eliminate uncertainties, and faults in multiple modules will lead to perception failures. Thus, identifying the root causes of these perception failures is crucial to ensure the reliability of MSF perception systems. Traditional methods for identifying perception failures, such as anomaly detection and runtime monitoring, are limited because they do not account for causal relationships between faults in multiple modules and overall system failure. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called interventional root cause analysis (IRCA). IRCA leverages the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of MSF to develop a hierarchical structural causal model (H-SCM), which effectively addresses the complexities of causal relationships. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer pruning algorithm to encompass multiple causal modules within a causal path and to pinpoint intervention targets. We implement IRCA and evaluate its performance using real fault scenarios and synthetic scenarios with injected faults in the ADS Autoware. The average F1-score of IRCA in real fault scenarios is over $95%$. We also illustrate the effectiveness of IRCA on an autonomous vehicle testbed equipped with Autoware, as well as a cross-platform evaluation using Apollo. The results show that IRCA can efficiently identify the causal paths leading to failures and significantly enhance the safety of ADS.

AB  - Memes have become a double-edged sword on social media platforms. On one hand, they facilitate the rapid dissemination of information and enhance communication. On the other hand, memes pose a risk of spreading harmful content under the guise of humor and virality. This duality highlights the need to develop effective moderation tools capable of identifying harmful memes. Current detection methods, however, face significant challenges in identifying harmful memes due to their inherent complexity. This complexity arises from the diverse forms of expression, intricate compositions, sophisticated propaganda techniques, and varied cultural contexts in which memes are created and circulated. These factors make it difficult for existing algorithms to distinguish between harmless and harmful content accurately. To understand and address these challenges, we first conduct a comprehensive study on harmful memes from two novel perspectives: visual arts and propaganda techniques. It aims to assess existing tools for detecting harmful memes and understand the complexities inherent in them. Our findings demonstrate that meme compositions and propaganda techniques can significantly diminish the effectiveness of current harmful meme detection methods. Inspired by our observations and understanding of harmful memes, we propose a novel framework called HMGUARD for effective detection of harmful memes. HMGUARD utilizes adaptive prompting and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). HMGUARD has demonstrated remarkable performance on the public harmful meme dataset, achieving an accuracy of 0.92. Compared to the baseline, HMGUARD represents a substantial improvement, with accuracy exceeding the baselines by 15% to 79.17%. Additionally, HMGUARD outperforms existing detection tools, achieving an impressive accuracy of 0.88 in real-world scenarios.

AB  - For decades, law enforcement and commercial entities have attempted botnet takedowns with mixed success. These efforts, relying on DNS sink-holing or seizing C&C infrastructure, require months of preparation and often omit the cleanup of left-over infected machines. This allows botnet operators to push updates to the bots and re-establish their control. In this paper, we expand the goal of malware takedowns to include the covert and timely removal of frontend bots from infected devices. Specifically, this work proposes seizing the malware's built-in update mechanism to distribute crafted remediation payloads. Our research aims to enable this necessary but challenging remediation step after obtaining legal permission. We developed ECHO, an automated malware forensics pipeline that extracts payload deployment routines and generates remediation payloads to disable or remove the frontend bots on infected devices. Our study of 702 Android malware shows that 523 malware can be remediated via ECHO's takedown approach, ranging from covertly warning users about malware infection to uninstalling the malware.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs), which laid the groundwork for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), have recently gained significant traction in academia and industry due to their disruptive applications. In order to enable scalable applications and efficient resource management, various multi-tenant LLM serving frameworks have been proposed, in which the LLM caters to the needs of multiple users simultaneously. One notable mechanism in recent works, such as SGLang and vLLM, is sharing the Key-Value (KV) cache for identical token sequences among multiple users, saving both memory and computation. This paper presents the first investigation on security risks
associated with multi-tenant LLM serving. We show that the state-of-the-art mechanisms of KV cache sharing may lead to new side channel attack vectors, allowing unauthorized reconstruction
of user prompts and compromising sensitive user information among mutually distrustful users. Specifically, we introduce our attack, PROMPTPEEK, and apply it to three scenarios where the
adversary, with varying degrees of prior knowledge, is capable of reverse-engineering prompts from other users. This study underscores the need for careful resource management in multi-tenant LLM serving and provides critical insights for future security enhancement.

AB  - Encrypted messaging systems obstruct content moderation, although they provide end-to-end security. As a result, misinformation proliferates in these systems, thereby exacerbating online hate and harassment. The paradigm of ``Reporting-then-Tracing" shows great potential in mitigating the spread of misinformation. For instance, textit{message traceback} (CCS'19) traces all the dissemination paths of a message, while textit{source tracing} (CCS'21) traces its originator.
However, message traceback lacks privacy preservation for non-influential users (e.g., users who only receive the message once), while source tracing maintains privacy but only provides limited traceability.

AB  - Industrial Control Systems (ICS) ensure the automation and safe operation of critical industry, energy, and commerce processes. Despite its importance, ICS code often cannot be evaluated as rigorously as software on traditional computing platforms, as existing code evaluation tools cannot readily interface with the closed ICS ecosystem. Moreover, the use of domain-specific languages, the lack of open and extensible compilers, and the deficiency of techniques developed for ICS-specific nuances, among other challenges, hinder the creation of specialized tools. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing ICSQuartz, the first native fuzzer for IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST), a standardized Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming language. Native support eliminates the necessity of any vendor or architecture-specific requirements.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-2156-paper.pdf
AB  - DNS-Based Blocklist (DNSBL) has been a longstanding, effective mitigation against malicious emails. While works have focused on evaluating the quality of such blocklists, much less is known about their adoption, end-to-end operation, and security problems. Powered by industrial datasets of nondelivery reports within 15 months, this paper first performs largescale measurements on the adoption of DNSBLs, reporting their prevalent usage by busy email servers. From an empirical study on the end-to-end operation of 29 DNSBL providers, we find they heavily rely on capture servers, concealed infrastructure to lure blind senders of spam, in generating blocklists. However, we find such capture servers can be exploited and report the HADES attack, where non-abusive email servers are deliberately injected into popular DNSBLs. Legitimate emails from victims will then be broadly rejected by their peers. Through field tests, we demonstrate the attack is effective at low costs: we successfully inject our experimental email servers into 14 DNSBLs, within a time frame ranging from as fast as three minutes to no longer than 24 hours. Practical assessment also uncovers significant attack potential targeting high-profile victims, e.g., large email service providers and popular websites. Upon responsible disclosure, five DNSBL providers have acknowledged the issue, and we also propose possible mitigation. Findings of this paper highlight the need for revisiting DNSBL security and guidelines in its operation.

AB  - CCD cameras are critical in professional and scientific applications where high-quality image data are required, and the reliability of the captured images forms the basis for trustworthy computer vision systems. Previous work shows the feasibility of using intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) to inject unnoticeable image changes into CCD cameras. In this work, we design an attack of enhanced capability, GhostShot, that can inject any grayscale or colored images into CCD cameras under normal light conditions with IEMI. We conduct a schematic analysis of the causality of the IEMI effect on the shapes, brightness, and colors of the injected images, and achieve effective control of the injected pattern through amplitude-phase modulation. We design an end-to-end attack workflow and successfully validate the attack on 15 commercial CCD cameras. We demonstrate the potential impact of GhostShot on medical diagnosis, fire detection, QR code scanning and object detection and find that the falsified images can successfully mislead computer vision systems and even human eyes.

This is because most mitigations hurt modern processors' speculative nature, which is essential to many optimization techniques. To address this, numerous scanners have been developed to identify vulnerable code snippets (speculative gadgets) within software applications, allowing mitigations to be applied selectively and thereby minimizing performance degradation.

AB  - Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specification describes a platform-independent pre-boot interface for an Operating System (OS). EDK-2 Vulnerabilities in UEFI interface functions have severe consequences and can lead to Bootkits and other persistent malware resilient to OS reinstallations. However, there exist no vulnerability detection techniques for UEFI interfaces. We present FUZZUER, a feedback-guided fuzzing technique for UEFI interfaces on EDK-2, an exemplary and prevalently used UEFI implementation. We designed FIRNESS that utilizes static analysis techniques to automatically generate fuzzing harnesses for interface functions. We evaluated FUZZUER on the latest version of EDK-2. Our comprehensive evaluation on 150 interface functions demonstrates that FUZZUER with FIRNESS is an effective testing technique of EDK-2’s UEFI interface functions, greatly outperforming HBFA, an existing testing tool with manually written harnesses. We found 20 new security vulnerabilities, and most of these are already acknowledged by the developers.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in tasks such as code understanding and generation. This study evaluates several advanced LLMs—such as LLaMA-2, CodeLLaMA, LLaMA-3, Mistral, Mixtral, Gemma, CodeGemma, Phi-2, Phi-3, and GPT-4—for vulnerability detection, primarily in Java, with additional tests in C/C++ to assess generalization. We transition from basic positive sample detection to a more challenging task involving both positive and negative samples and evaluate the LLMs’ ability to identify specific vulnerability types. Performance is analyzed using runtime and detection accuracy in zero-shot and few-shot settings with custom and generic metrics. Key insights include the strong performance of models like Gemma and LLaMA-2 in identifying vulnerabilities, though this success varies, with some configurations performing no better than random guessing. Performance also fluctuates significantly across programming languages and learning modes (zero- vs. few-shot). We further investigate the impact of model parameters, quantization methods, context window (CW) sizes, and architectural choices on vulnerability detection. While CW consistently enhances performance, benefits from other parameters, such as quantization, are more limited. Overall, our findings underscore the potential of LLMs in automated vulnerability detection, the complex interplay of model parameters, and the current limitations in varied scenarios and configurations.

AB  - With the proliferation of IoT devices, network device identification is essential for effective network management and security. Many exhibit performance degradation despite the potential of machine learning-based IoT device identification solutions. Degradation arises from the assumption of static IoT environments that do not account for the diversity of real-world IoT networks, as devices operate in various modes and evolve over time. In this paper, we evaluate current IoT device identification solutions using curated datasets and representative features across different settings. We consider key factors that affect real-world device identification, including modes of operation, spatio-temporal variations, and traffic sampling, and organise them into a set of attributes by which we can evaluate current solutions. We then use machine learning explainability techniques to pinpoint the key causes of performance degradation. This evaluation uncovers empirical evidence of what continuously identifies devices, provides valuable insights, and practical recommendations for network operators to improve their IoT device identification in operational deployments.

TI  - Enhancing Security in Third-Party Library Reuse – Comprehensive Detection of 1-day Vulnerability through Code Patch Analysis
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-576-paper.pdf
AB  - Nowadays, software development progresses
rapidly to incorporate new features. To facilitate such growth
and provide convenience for developers when creating and
updating software, reusing open-source software (i.e., thirdparty
library reuses) has become one of the most effective
and efficient methods. Unfortunately, the practice of reusing
third-party libraries (TPLs) can also introduce vulnerabilities
(known as 1-day vulnerabilities) because of the low maintenance
of TPLs, resulting in many vulnerable versions remaining in
use. If the software incorporating these TPLs fails to detect the
introduced vulnerabilities and leads to delayed updates, it will
exacerbate the security risks. However, the complicated code
dependencies and flexibility of TPL reuses make the detection of
1-day vulnerability a challenging task. To support developers in
securely reusing TPLs during software development, we design
and implement VULTURE, an effective and efficient detection
tool, aiming at identifying 1-day vulnerabilities that arise from
the reuse of vulnerable TPLs. It first executes a database creation
method, TPLFILTER, which leverages the Large Language
Model (LLM) to automatically build a unique database for the
targeted platform. Instead of relying on code-level similarity
comparison, VULTURE employs hashing-based comparison to
explore the dependencies among the collected TPLs and identify
the similarities between the TPLs and the target projects.
Recognizing that developers have the flexibility to reuse TPLs
exactly or in a custom manner, VULTURE separately conducts
version-based comparison and chunk-based analysis to capture
fine-grained semantic features at the function levels. We applied
VULTURE to 10 real-world projects to assess its effectiveness
and efficiency in detecting 1-day vulnerabilities. VULTURE
successfully identified 175 vulnerabilities from 178 reused TPLs.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-200-paper.pdf
AB  - Iris recognition is one of the most secure biometric methods due to the uniqueness and stability of iris patterns, as well as their resistance to forgery. Consequently, it is frequently used in high-security authentication scenarios. However, systems using Near-Infrared (NIR) sensors may expose the iris information of users, leading to significant privacy risks. Our research found that the electromagnetic (EM) emissions generated during data transmission of NIR sensors are closely related to iris data. Based on this observation, we propose EMIRIS, a method for reconstructing the iris information using EM side channels. By deconstructing the digital signal transmission format of the NIR sensors and the mapping mechanism of the iris data matrix, we can reconstruct iris information from EM signals and convert it into iris images. To improve the quality of the reconstructed iris, we model the denoising and restoration of iris texture details as a linear inverse problem and tailor a diffusion model to solve it. Extensive experimental evaluations show that EMIRIS can effectively reconstruct iris information from commercial iris recognition devices, achieving an average SSIM of 0.511 and an average FID of 7.25. Even more concerning, these reconstructed irises can effectively spoof the classical iris recognition model with an average success rate of 53.47% on more than 3,000 iris samples from 50 different users.

TI  - EAGLEYE: Exposing Hidden Web Interfaces in IoT Devices via Routing Analysis
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-399-paper.pdf
AB  - Hidden web interfaces, i.e., undisclosed access channels in IoT devices, introduce great security risks and have resulted in severe attacks in recent years. However, the definition of such threats is vague, and few solutions are able to discover them. Due to their hidden nature, traditional bug detection solutions (e.g., taint analysis, fuzzing) are hard to detect them. In this paper, we present a novel solution EAGLEYE to automatically expose hidden web interfaces in IoT devices. By analyzing input requests to public interfaces, we first identify routing tokens within the requests, i.e., those values (e.g., actions or file names) that are referenced and used as index by the firmware code (routing mechanism) to find associated handler functions. Then, we utilize modern large language models to analyze the contexts of such routing tokens and deduce their common pattern, and then infer other candidate values (e.g., other actions or file names) of these tokens. Lastly, we perform a hidden-interface directed black-box fuzzing, which mutates the routing tokens in input requests with these candidate values as the high-quality dictionary. We have implemented a prototype of EAGLEYE and evaluated it on 13 different commercial IoT devices. EAGLEYE successfully found 79 hidden interfaces, 25X more than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution IoTScope. Among them, we further discovered 29 unknown vulnerabilities including backdoor, XSS (cross-site scripting), command injection, and information leakage, and have received 7 CVEs.

AB  - Web browsers are ubiquitous and execute untrusted JavaScript (JS) code. JS engines optimize frequently executed code through just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Subtly conflicting assumptions between optimizations frequently result in JS engine vulnerabilities. Attackers can take advantage of such diverging assumptions and use the flexibility of JS to craft exploits that produce a miscalculation, remove bounds checks in JIT compiled code, and ultimately gain arbitrary code execution. Classical fuzzing approaches for JS engines only detect bugs if the engine crashes or a runtime assertion fails. Differential fuzzing can compare interpreted code against optimized JIT compiled code to detect differences in execution. Recent approaches probe the execution states of JS programs through ad-hoc JS functions that read the value of variables at runtime. However, these approaches have limited capabilities to detect diverging executions and inhibit
optimizations during JIT compilation, thus leaving JS engines under-tested.

TI  - DShield: Defending against Backdoor Attacks on Graph Neural Networks via Discrepancy Learning
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-798-paper.pdf
AB  - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where triggers inserted into original graphs cause adversary-determined predictions. Backdoor attacks on GNNs, typically focusing on node classification tasks, are categorized by dirty- and clean-label attacks and pose challenges due to the interconnected nature of normal and poisoned nodes. Current defenses are indeed circumvented by sophisticated triggers and often rely on strong assumptions borrowed from other domains (e.g., rapid loss drops on poisoned images). They lead to high attack risks, failing to effectively protect against both dirty- and clean-label attacks simultaneously. To tackle these challenges, we propose DShield, a comprehensive defense framework with a discrepancy learning mechanism to defend against various graph backdoor attacks. Specifically, we reveal two vital facts during the attacking process: *semantic drift* where dirty-label attacks modify the semantic information of poisoned nodes, and *attribute over-emphasis* where clean-label attacks exaggerate specific attributes to enforce adversary-determined predictions. Motivated by those, DShield employs a self-supervised learning framework to construct a model without relying on manipulated label information. Subsequently, it utilizes both the self-supervised and backdoored models to analyze discrepancies in semantic information and attribute importance, effectively filtering out poisoned nodes. Finally, DShield trains normal models using the preserved nodes, thereby minimizing the impact of poisoned nodes. Compared with 6 state-of-the-art defenses under 21 backdoor attacks, we conduct evaluations on 7 datasets with 2 victim models to demonstrate that DShield effectively mitigates backdoor threats with minimal degradation in performance on normal nodes. For instance, on the Cora dataset, DShield reduces the attack success rate to 1.33% from 54.47% achieved by the second-best defense Prune while maintaining an 82.15% performance on normal nodes.

AB  - Open redirects are one of the oldest threats to web applications, allowing attackers to reroute users to malicious websites by exploiting a web application's redirection mechanism. The recent shift towards client-side task offloading has introduced JavaScript-based redirections, formerly handled server-side, thereby posing additional security risks to open redirections. In this paper, we re-assess the significance of open redirect vulnerabilities by focusing on client-side redirections, which despite their importance, have been largely understudied by the community due to open redirect's long-standing low impact. To address this gap, we introduce a static-dynamic system, STORK, designed to extract vulnerability indicators for open redirects. Applying STORK to the Tranco top 10K sites, we conduct a large-scale measurement, uncovering 20.8K open redirect vulnerabilities across 623 sites and compiling a catalog of 184 vulnerability indicators. Afterwards, we use our indicators to mine vulnerabilities from snapshots of live webpages, Google search and Internet Archive, identifying additionally 326 vulnerable sites, including Google WebLight and DoubleClick. Then, we explore the extent to which their exploitation can lead to more critical threats, quantifying the impact of client-side open redirections in the wild. Our study finds that over 11.5% of the open redirect vulnerabilities across 38% of the affected sites could be escalated to XSS, CSRF and information leakage, including popular sites like Adobe, WebNovel, TP-Link, and UDN, which is alarming. Finally, we review and evaluate the adoption of mitigation techniques against open redirections.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1796-paper.pdf
AB  - Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global machine learning model through a server, without exchanging their private training data. However, the decentralized aspect of FL makes it susceptible to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients can manipulate the global model by sending altered local model updates. To counter these attacks, a variety of aggregation rules designed to be resilient to Byzantine failures have been introduced. Nonetheless, these methods can still be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks or depend on unrealistic assumptions about the server. In this paper, we demonstrate that there is no need to design new Byzantine-robust aggregation rules; instead, FL can be secured by enhancing the robustness of well-established aggregation rules. To this end, we present FoundationFL, a novel defense mechanism against poisoning attacks. FoundationFL involves the server generating synthetic updates after receiving local model updates from clients. It then applies existing Byzantine-robust foundational aggregation rules, such as Trimmed-mean or Median, to combine clients' model updates with the synthetic ones. We theoretically establish the convergence performance of FoundationFL under Byzantine settings. Comprehensive experiments across several real-world datasets validate the efficiency of our FoundationFL method.

AB  - We design DiStefano: an efficient, maliciously-secure framework for generating private commitments over TLS-encrypted web traffic, for verification by a designated third-party. DiStefano provides many improvements over previous TLS commitment systems, including: a modular protocol specific to TLS 1.3, support for arbitrary verifiable claims over encrypted data, client browsing history privacy amongst pre-approved TLS servers, and various optimisations to ensure fast online performance of the TLS 1.3 session. We build a permissive open-source implementation of DiStefano integrated into the BoringSSL cryptographic library (used by Chromium-based Internet browsers). We show that DiStefano is practical in both LAN and WAN settings for committing to facts in arbitrary TLS traffic, requiring < 1 s and ≤ 80 KiB to execute the complete online phase of the protocol.

AB  - IMSI-Catchers allow parties other than cellular network providers to covertly track mobile device users. While the research community has developed many tools to combat this problem, current solutions focus on correlated behavior and are therefore subject to substantial false classifications. In this paper, we present a standards-driven methodology that focuses on the messages an IMSI-Catcher textit{must} use to cause mobile devices to provide their permanent identifiers. That is, our approach focuses on causal attributes rather than correlated ones. We systematically analyze message flows that would lead to IMSI exposure (most of which have not been previously considered in the research community), and identify 53 messages an IMSI-Catcher can use for its attack. We then perform a measurement study on two continents to characterize the ratio in which connections use these messages in normal operations. We use these benchmarks to compare against open-source IMSI-Catcher implementations and then observe anomalous behavior at a large-scale event with significant media attention. Our analysis strongly implies the presence of an IMSI-Catcher at said public event ($p << 0.005$), thus representing the first publication to provide evidence of the statistical significance of its findings.

AB  - Function Secret Sharing (FSS) has emerged as a pivotal cryptographic tool for secure computation, delivering exceptional online efficiency with constant interaction rounds. However, the reliance on a trusted third party for key generation in existing FSS works compromises both security and practical deployment. In this paper, we introduce efficient distributed key generation schemes for FSS-based distributed point function and distributed comparison function, supporting both input and output to be arithmetic-shared. We further design crucial FSS-based components optimized for online efficiency, serving as the building blocks for advanced protocols. Finally, we propose an efficient framework for evaluating complex trigonometric functions, ubiquitous in scientific computations. Our framework leverages the periodic property of trigonometric functions, which reduces the bit length of input during FSS evaluation. This mitigates the potential performance bottleneck for FSS-based protocols incurred by bit length. Extensive empirical evaluations on real-world applications demonstrate a latency reduction of up to $14.73times$ and a communication cost decrease ranging from $27.67sim 184.42 times$ over the state-of-the-art work.

AB  - Sharing training data for deep learning raises critical concerns about data leakage, as third-party AI developers take full control over the data once it is handed over to them.  The problem becomes even worse if the model trained using the data should be returned to the third-party AI developers - e.g., healthcare startup training its own model using the medical data rented from a hospital.  In this case, the malicious developers can easily leak the training data through the model as he can construct an arbitrary data flow between them - e.g., directly encoding raw training data into the model, or stealthily biasing the model to resemble the training data.  However, current model training frameworks do not provide any protection to prevent such training data leakage, allowing the untrusted AI developers to leak the data without any restriction.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-90-paper.pdf
AB  - Model pruning is a technique for compressing deep learning models, and using an iterative way to prune the model can achieve better compression effects with lower utility loss. However, our analysis reveals that iterative pruning significantly increases model memorization, making the pruned models more vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing defenses against MIAs are designed for original and unpruned models. In this paper, we propose a new framework WeMem to weaken memorization in the iterative pruning process. Specifically, our analysis identifies two important factors that increase memorization in iterative pruning, namely data reuse and inherent memorability. We consider the individual and combined impacts of both factors, forming three scenarios that lead to increased memorization in iteratively pruned models. We design three defense primitives based on these factors' characteristics. By combining these primitives, we propose methods tailored to each scenario to weaken memorization effectively. Comprehensive experiments under ten adaptive MIAs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defenses. Moreover, our defenses outperform five existing defenses in terms of privacy-utility tradeoff and efficiency. Additionally, we enhance the proposed defenses to automatically adjust settings for optimal defense, improving their practicability.

AB  - Wireless technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi are essential to the Internet of Things (IoT), facilitating seamless device communication without physical connections. However, this convenience comes at a cost—exposed data exchanges that are susceptible to observation by attackers, leading to serious security and privacy threats such as device tracking. Although protocol designers have traditionally relied on strategies like address and identity randomization as a countermeasure, our research reveals that these attacks remain a significant threat due to a historically overlooked, fundamental flaw in exclusive-use wireless communication. We define _exclusive-use_ as a scenario where devices are designed to provide functionality solely to an
associated or paired device. The unique communication patterns inherent in these relationships create an observable boolean side-channel that attackers can exploit to discover whether two devices “trust” each other. This information leak allows for the deanonymization of devices, enabling tracking even in the presence of modern countermeasures. We introduce our tracking attacks as _IDBleed_ and demonstrate that BLE and Wi-Fi protocols that support confidentiality, integrity, and authentication remain vulnerable to deanonymization due to this fundamental flaw in exclusive-use communication patterns. Finally, we propose and quantitatively evaluate a generalized, privacy-preserving mitigation we call _Anonymization Layer_ to find a negligible 2% approximate overhead in performance and power consumption on tested smartphones and PCs.

TI  - Detecting Ransomware Despite I/O Overhead: A Practical Multi-Staged Approach
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-764-paper.pdf
AB  - Ransomware attacks have become one of the most widely feared cyber attacks for businesses and home users.
Since attacks are evolving and use advanced phishing campaigns and zero-day exploits, everyone is at risk, ranging from novice users to experts.
As a result, much research has focused on preventing and detecting ransomware attacks, with real-time monitoring of I/O activity being the most prominent approach for detection.
These approaches have in common that they inject code into the execution of the operating system's I/O stack, a more and more optimized system.
However, they seemingly do not consider the impact the integration of such mechanisms would have on system performance or only consider slow storage mediums, such as rotational hard disk drives.
This paper analyzes the impact of monitoring different features of relevant I/O operations for Windows and Linux.
We find that even simple features, such as the entropy of a buffer, can increase execution time by 350% and reduce SSD performance by up to 75%.
To combat this degradation, we propose adjusting the number of monitored features based on a process's behavior in real-time.
To this end, we design and implement a multi-staged IDS that can adjust overhead by moving a process between stages that monitor different numbers of features.
By moving seemingly benign processes to stages with fewer features and less overhead while moving suspicious processes to stages with more features to confirm the suspicion, the average time a system requires to perform I/O operations can be reduced drastically.
We evaluate the effectiveness of our design by combining actual I/O behavior from a public dataset with the measurements we gathered for each I/O operation and found that a multi-staged design can reduce the overhead to I/O operations by an order of magnitude while maintaining similar detection accuracy of traditional single-staged approaches.
As a result, real-time behavior monitoring for ransomware detection becomes feasible despite its inherent overhead impacts.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-2185-paper.pdf
AB  - As quantum computing rapidly advances, its near-term applications are becoming increasingly evident. However, the high cost and under-utilization of quantum resources are prompting a shift from single-user to multi-user access models. In a multi-tenant environment, where multiple users share one quantum computer, protecting user confidentiality becomes crucial. The varied uses of quantum computers increase the risk that sensitive data encoded by one user could be compromised by others, rendering the protection of data integrity and confidentiality essential.
In the evolving quantum computing landscape, it is imperative to study these security challenges within the scope of realistic threat model assumptions,
wherein an adversarial user can mount practical attacks without relying on any heightened privileges afforded by physical access to a quantum computer or rogue cloud services.
In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of crosstalk as an attack vector for the first time on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machine, that an adversarial user can exploit within a multi-tenant quantum computing model.
The proposed side-channel attack is conducted with minimal and realistic adversarial privileges, with the overarching aim of uncovering the quantum algorithm being executed by a victim. Crosstalk signatures are used to estimate the presence of CNOT gates in the victim circuit, and subsequently, this information is encoded and classified by a graph-based learning model to identify the victim quantum algorithm. When evaluated on up to 336 benchmark circuits, our attack framework is found to be able to unveil the victim's quantum algorithm with up to 85.7% accuracy.

Prior work has studied specific scam types, but no work has compared different scam types. In this work, we perform what we believe is the first study of the exposure of end users to different types of online scams. We examine seven popular scam types: shopping, financial, cryptocurrency, gambling, dating, funds recovery, and employment scams. To quantify end-user exposure, we search for observations of 607K scam domains over a period of several months by millions of desktop and mobile devices belonging to customers of a large cybersecurity vendor. We classify the scam domains into the seven scam types and measure for each scam type the exposure of end users, geographical variations, scam domain lifetime, and the promotion of scam websites through online advertisements.

AB  - Cochlear implants (CIs) allow deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to use audio devices, such as phones or voice assistants. However, the advent of increasingly sophisticated synthetic audio (i.e., deepfakes) potentially threatens these users. Yet, this population's susceptibility to such attacks is unclear. In this paper, we perform the first study of the impact of audio deepfakes on CI populations. We examine the use of CI-simulated audio within deepfake detectors. Based on these results, we conduct a user study with 35 CI users and 87 hearing persons (HPs) to determine differences in how CI users perceive deepfake audio. We show that CI users can, similarly to HPs, identify text-to-speech generated deepfakes. Yet, they perform substantially worse for voice conversion deepfake generation algorithms, achieving only 67% correct audio classification. We also evaluate how detection models trained on a CI-simulated audio compare to CI users and investigate if they can effectively act as proxies for CI users. This work begins an investigation into the intersection between adversarial audio and CI users to identify and mitigate threats against this marginalized group.

AB  - Nowadays, SELinux has been widely used to provide flexible mandatory access control and security policies are critical to maintain the security of operating systems. Strictly speaking, all access requests must be restricted by appropriate policy rules to satisfy the functional requirements of the software or application. However, manually configuring security policy rules is an error-prone and time-consuming task that often requires expert knowledge. Therefore, it is a challenging task to recommend policy rules without anomalies effectively due to the numerous policy rules and the complexity of semantics. The majority of previous research mined information from policies to recommend rules but did not apply to the newly defined types without any rules. In this paper, we propose a context-aware security policy recommendation (CASPR) method that can automatically analyze and refine security policy rules. Context-aware information in CASPR includes policy rules, file locations, audit logs, and attribute information. According to these context-aware information, multiple features are extracted to calculate the similarity of privilege sets. Based on the calculation results, CASPR clusters types by the K-means model and then recommends rules automatically. The method automatically detects anomalies in security policy, namely, constraint conflicts, policy inconsistencies, and permission incompleteness. Further, the detected anomalous policies are refined so that the authorization rules can be effectively enforced.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-294-paper.pdf
AB  - Confidential Computing (CC) has received increasing attention in recent years as a mechanism to protect user data from untrusted operating systems (OSes). Existing CC solutions hide confidential memory from the OS and/or encrypt it to achieve confidentiality. In doing so, they render OS memory optimization unusable or complicate the trusted computing base (TCB) required for optimization. This paper presents our results toward overcoming these limitations, synthesized in a CC design named Blindfold. Like many other CC solutions, Blindfold relies on a small trusted software component running at a higher privilege level than the kernel, called Guardian. It features three techniques that can enhance existing CC solutions. First, instead of nesting page tables, Blindfold’s Guardian mediates how the OS accesses memory and handles exceptions by switching page and interrupt tables. Second, Blindfold employs a lightweight capability system to regulate the OS’s semantic access to user memory, unifying case-by-case approaches in previous work. Finally, Blindfold provides carefully designed secure ABI for confidential memory management without encryption. We report an implementation of Blindfold that works on ARMv8-A/Linux. Using Blindfold's prototype, we are able to evaluate the cost of enabling confidential memory management by the untrusted Linux kernel. We show Blindfold has a smaller runtime TCB than related systems and enjoys competitive performance. More importantly, we show that the Linux kernel, including all of its memory optimizations except memory compression, can function properly for confidential memory. This requires only about 400 lines of kernel modifications.

AB  - This paper presents DistFuzz, which, to our knowledge, is the first feedback-guided blackbox fuzzing framework for distributed systems. The novelty of DistFuzz comes from two conceptual contributions on key aspects of distributed system fuzzing: the input space and feedback metrics. Specifically, unlike prior work that focuses on systematically mutating faults, exploiting the request-driven and timing-dependence nature of distributed systems, DistFuzz proposes a multi-dimensional input space by incorporating regular events and relative timing among events as the other two dimensions. Furthermore, observing that important state changes in distributed systems can be indicated by network messages among nodes, DistFuzz utilizes the sequences of network messages with symmetry-based pruning as program feedback, which departs from the conventional wisdom that effective feedback requires code instrumentation/analysis and/or user inputs. DistFuzz finds 52 real bugs in ten popular distributed systems in C/C++, Go, and Java. Among these bugs, 28 have been confirmed by the developers, 20 were unknown before, and 4 have been assigned with CVEs.

BFAs can manipulate DNN prediction and completely deplete DNN intelligence, and can be launched against both DNNs running on deep learning (DL) frameworks like PyTorch, as well as those compiled into standalone executables by DL compilers. While BFA defenses have been proposed for models on DL frameworks, we find them incapable of protecting DNN executables due to the new attack vectors on these executables.

AB  - Function name inference in stripped binaries is an important yet challenging task for many security applications, such as malware analysis and vulnerability discovery, due to the need to grasp binary code semantics amidst diverse instruction sets, architectures, compiler optimizations, and obfuscations. While machine learning has made significant progress in this field, existing methods often struggle with unseen data, constrained by their reliance on a limited vocabulary-based classification approach. In this paper, we present SymGen, a novel framework employing an autoregressive generation paradigm powered by domain-adapted generative large language models (LLMs) for enhanced binary code interpretation. We have evaluated SymGen on a dataset comprising 2,237,915 binary functions across four architectures (x86-64, x86-32, ARM, MIPS) with four levels of optimizations (O0-O3) where it surpasses the state-of-the-art with up to 409.3%, 553.5%, and 489.4% advancement in precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively, showing superior effectiveness and generalizability. Our ablation and case studies also demonstrate the significant performance boosts achieved by our design, e.g., the domain adaptation approach, alongside showcasing SymGen’s practicality in analyzing real-world binaries, e.g., obfuscated binaries and malware executables.

TI  - BARBIE: Robust Backdoor Detection Based on Latent Separability
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-179-paper.pdf
AB  - Backdoor attacks are an essential risk to deep learning model sharing. Fundamentally, backdoored models are different from benign models considering latent separability, i.e., distinguishable differences in model latent representations. However, existing methods quantify latent separability by clustering latent representations or computing distances between latent representations, which are easy to be compromised by adaptive attacks. In this paper, we propose BARBIE, a backdoor detection approach that can pinpoint latent separability under adaptive backdoor attacks. To achieve this goal, we propose a new latent separability metric, named relative competition score (RCS), by characterizing the dominance of latent representations over model output, which is robust against various backdoor attacks and is hard to compromise. Without the need to access any benign or backdoored sample, we invert two sets of latent representations of each label, reflecting the normal latent representations of benign models and intensifying the abnormal ones of backdoored models, to calculate RCS. We compute a series of RCS-based indicators to comprehensively reflect the differences between backdoored models and benign models. We validate the effectiveness of BARBIE on more than 10,000 models on 4 datasets against 14 types of backdoor attacks, including the adaptive attacks against latent separability. Compared with 7 baselines, BARBIE improves the average true positive rate by 17.05% against source-agnostic attacks, 27.72% against source-specific attacks, 43.17% against sample-specific attacks and 11.48% against clean-label attacks. BARBIE also maintains lower false positive rates than baselines. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Forliqr/BARBIE.

TI  - Balancing Privacy and Data Utilization: A Comparative Vignette Study on User Acceptance of Data Trustees in Germany and the US
PY  - 2025

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1982-paper.pdf
AB  - In times of big data, connected devices, and increasing self-measurement, protecting consumer privacy remains a challenge despite ongoing technological and legislative efforts. Data trustees present a promising solution, aiming to balance data utilization with privacy concerns by facilitating secure data sharing and ensuring individual control. However, successful implementation hinges on user acceptance and trust.
We conducted a large-scale, vignette-based, census-representative online study examining factors influencing the acceptance of data trustees for medical, automotive, IoT, and online data. With n=714 participants from Germany and n=1036 from the US, our study reveals varied willingness to use data trustees across both countries, with notable skepticism and outright rejection from a significant portion of users.
We also identified significant domain-specific differences, including the influence of user anonymity, perceived personal and societal benefits, and the recipients of the data.
Contrary to common beliefs, organizational and regulatory decisions such as the storage location, the operator, and supervision appeared less relevant to users' decisions.
In conclusion, while there exists a potential user base for data trustees, achieving widespread acceptance will require explicit and targeted implementation strategies tailored to address diverse user expectations. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding these nuances for effectively deploying data trustee frameworks that meet both regulatory requirements and user preferences while upholding highest security and privacy standards.

TI  - Automatic Library Fuzzing through API Relation Evolvement

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-750-paper.pdf
AB  - Software libraries are foundational components in modern software ecosystems. Vulnerabilities within these libraries pose significant security threats. Fuzzing is a widely used technique for uncovering software vulnerabilities. However, its application to software libraries poses considerable challenges, necessitating carefully crafted drivers that reflect diverse yet correct API usages. Existing works on automatic library fuzzing either suffer from high false positives due to API misuse caused by arbitrarily generated API sequences, or fail to produce diverse API sequences by overly relying on existing code snippets that express restricted API usages, thus missing deeper API vulnerabilities.
This work proposes NEXZZER, a new fuzzer that automatically detects vulnerabilities in libraries. NEXZZER employs a hybrid relation learning strategy to continuously infer and evolve API relations, incorporating a novel driver architecture to augment the testing coverage of libraries and facilitate deep vulnerability discovery. We evaluated NEXZZER across 18 libraries and the Google Fuzzer Test Suite. The results demonstrate its considerable advantages in code coverage and vulnerability-finding capabilities compared to prior works. NEXZZER can also automatically identify and filter out most API misuse crashes. Moreover, NEXZZER discovered 27 previously unknown vulnerabilities in well-tested libraries, including OpenSSL and libpcre2. At the time of writing, developers have confirmed 24 of them, and 9 were fixed because of our reports.

TI  - Automatic Insecurity: Exploring Email Auto-configuration in the Wild
PY  - 2025

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1078-paper.pdf
AB  - Email clients that support auto-configuration mechanisms automatically retrieve server configuration information, such as the hostname, port number, and connection type, allowing users to log in by simply entering email addresses and passwords. Auto-configuration mechanisms are being increasingly adopted. However, the security implications of these mechanisms, both in terms of implementation and deployment, have not yet been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of security threats associated with email auto-configuration and evaluate their impacts. We summarize 10 attack scenarios, covering 17 defects (including 8 newly identified ones), along with 4 inadequate client UI notifications. These attack scenarios can either cause a victim to connect to an attacker-controlled server or establish an insecure connection, putting the victim’s credentials at risk. Moreover, our large-scale measurements and in-depth analysis revealed serious insecurity of auto-configuration applications in the wild. On the server-side, we discovered 49,013 domains, including 19 of the Top-1K popular domains, were misconfigured. On the client-side, 22 out of 29 clients were vulnerable to those threats. Moreover, 27 out of 29 clients exhibited at least one UI-notification defect that facilitates silent attacks. These defects arise from misconfiguration, mismanagement, flawed implementation and compatibility. We hope this paper raises attention to email auto-configuration security.

TI  - Automated Mass Malware Factory: The Convergence of Piggybacking and Adversarial Example in Android Malicious Software Generation
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1933-paper.pdf
AB  - Adversarial example techniques have been demonstrated to be highly effective against Android malware detection systems, enabling malware to evade detection with minimal code modifications. However, existing adversarial example techniques overlook the process of malware generation, thus restricting the applicability of adversarial example techniques. In this paper, we investigate piggybacked malware, a type of malware generated in bulk by piggybacking malicious code into popular apps, and combine it with adversarial example techniques. Given a malicious code segment (i.e., a rider), we can generate adversarial perturbations tailored to it and insert them into any carrier, enabling the resulting malware to evade detection. Through exploring the mechanism by which adversarial perturbation affects piggybacked malware code, we propose an adversarial piggybacked malware generation method, which comprises three modules: Malicious Rider Extraction, Adversarial Perturbation Generation, and Benign Carrier Selection. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method can efficiently generate a large volume of malware in a short period, and significantly increase the likelihood of evading detection. Our method achieved an average attack success rate (ASR) of 88.3% on machine learning-based detection models (e.g., Drebin and MaMaDroid), and an ASR of 76% and 92% on commercial engines Microsoft and Kingsoft, respectively. Furthermore, we have explored potential defenses against our adversarial piggybacked malware.

PY  - 2025

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-613-paper.pdf
AB  - Critical open-source projects form the basis of many large software systems. They provide trusted and extensible implementations of important functionality for cryptography, compatibility, and security. Verifying commit authorship authenticity in open-source projects is essential and challenging. Git users can freely configure author details such as names and email addresses. Platforms like GitHub use such information to generate profile links to user accounts. We demonstrate three attack scenarios malicious actors can use to manipulate projects and profiles on GitHub to appear trustworthy. We designed a mixed-research study to assess the effect on critical open-source software projects and evaluated countermeasures. First, we conducted a large-scale measurement among 50,328 critical open-source projects on GitHub and demonstrated that contribution workflows can be abused in 85.9% of the projects. We identified 573,043 email addresses that a malicious actor can claim to hijack historic contributions and improve the trustworthiness of their accounts. When looking at commit signing as a countermeasure, we found that the majority of users (95.4%) never signed a commit, and for the majority of projects (72.1%), no commit was ever signed. In contrast, only 2.0% of the users signed all their commits, and for 0.2% of the projects all commits were signed. Commit signing is not associated with projects’ programming languages, topics, or other security measures. Second, we analyzed online security advice to explore the awareness of contributor spoofing and identify recommended countermeasures. Most documents exhibit awareness of the simple spoofing technique via Git commits but no awareness of problems with GitHub’s handling of email addresses.

AB  - On-device deep learning, increasingly popular for enhancing user privacy, now poses a serious risk to the privacy of deep neural network (DNN) models. Researchers have proposed to leverage Arm TrustZone's trusted execution environment (TEE) to protect models from attacks originating in the rich execution environment (REE). Existing solutions, however, fall short: (i) those that fully contain DNN inference within a TEE either support inference on CPUs only, or require substantial modifications to closed-source proprietary software for incorporating accelerators; (ii) those that offload part of DNN inference to the REE either leave a portion of DNNs unprotected, or incur large run-time overheads due to frequent model (de)obfuscation and TEE-to-REE exits.

TI  - BinEnhance: An Enhancement Framework Based on External Environment Semantics for Binary Code Search
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-568-paper.pdf
AB  - Binary code search plays a crucial role in applications like software reuse detection, and vulnerability identification. Currently, existing models are typically based on either internal code semantics or a combination of function call graphs (CG) and internal code semantics. However, these models have limitations. Internal code semantic models only consider the semantics within the function, ignoring the inter-function semantics, making it difficult to handle situations such as function inlining. The combination of CG and internal code semantics is insufficient for addressing complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose BINENHANCE, a novel framework designed to leverage the inter-function semantics to enhance the expression of internal code semantics for binary code search. Specifically, BINENHANCE constructs an External Environment Semantic Graph (EESG), which establishes a stable and analogous external environment for homologous functions by using different inter-function semantic relation (textit{e.g.}, textit{call}, textit{location}, textit{data-co-use}). After the construction of EESG, we utilize the embeddings generated by existing internal code semantic models to initialize EESG nodes. Finally, we design a Semantic Enhancement Model (SEM) that uses Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCNs) and a residual block to learn valuable external semantics on the EESG for generating the enhanced semantics embedding. In addition, BinEnhance utilizes data feature similarity to refine the cosine similarity of semantic embeddings. We conduct experiments under six different tasks (textit{e.g.}, under textit{function inlining} scenario) and the results illustrate the performance and robustness of BINENHANCE. The application of BinEnhance to HermesSim, Asm2vec, TREX, Gemini, and Asteria on two public datasets results in an improvement of Mean Average Precision (MAP) from 53.6% to 69.7%. Moreover, the efficiency increases fourfold.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-1887-paper.pdf
AB  - We present the first systematic study of database ransom(ware) attacks, a class of attacks where attackers scan for database servers, log in by leveraging the lack of authentication or weak credentials, drop the database contents, and demand a ransom to return the deleted data. We examine 23,736 ransom notes collected from 60,427 compromised database servers over three years, and set up database honeypots to obtain a first-hand view of current attacks. Database ransom(ware) attacks are prevalent with 6K newly infected servers in March 2024, a 60% increase over a year earlier. Our honeypots get infected in 14 hours since they are connected to the Internet. Weak authentication issues are two orders of magnitude more frequent on Elasticsearch servers compared to MySQL servers due to slow adoption of the latest Elasticsearch versions. To analyze who is behind database ransom(ware) attacks we implement a clustering approach that first identifies campaigns using the similarity of the ransom notes text. Then, it determines which campaigns are run by the same group by leveraging indicator reuse and information from the Bitcoin blockchain. For each group, it computes properties such as the number of compromised servers, the lifetime, the revenue, and the indicators used. Our approach identifies that the 60,427 database servers are victims of 91 campaigns run by 32 groups. It uncovers a dominant group responsible for 76% of the infected servers and 90% of the financial impact. We find links between the dominant group, a nation-state, and a previous attack on Git repositories.

AB  - Over the past decade, cryptocurrencies have garnered attention from academia and industry alike, fostering a diverse blockchain ecosystem and novel applications. The inception of bridges improved interoperability, enabling asset transfers across different blockchains to capitalize on their unique features. Despite their surge in popularity and the emergence of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), trustless bridge protocols remain inefficient, either relaying too much information (e.g., light-client-based bridges) or demanding expensive computation (e.g., zk-based bridges). These inefficiencies arise because existing bridges securely prove a transaction's on-chain inclusion on another blockchain. Yet this is unnecessary as off-chain solutions, like payment and state channels, permit safe transactions without on-chain publication. However, existing bridges do not support the verification of off-chain payments.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-532-paper.pdf
AB  - Various email protocols, including IMAP, POP3, and SMTP, were originally designed as “plaintext” protocols without inbuilt confidentiality and integrity guarantees. To protect the communication traffic, TLS can either be used implicitly before the start of those email protocols, or introduced as an opportunistic upgrade in a post-hoc fashion. In order to improve user experience, many email clients nowadays provide a so-called “auto-detect” feature to automatically determine a functional set of configuration parameters for the users. In this paper, we present a multifaceted study on the security of the use of TLS and auto-detect in email clients. First, to evaluate the design and implementation of client-side TLS and auto-detect, we tested 49 email clients and uncovered various flaws that can lead to covert security downgrade and exposure of user credentials to attackers. Second, to understand whether current deployment practices adequately avoid the security traps introduced by opportunistic TLS and auto-detect, we collected and analyzed 1102 email setup guides from academic institutes across the world, and observed problems that can drive users to adopt insecure email settings. Finally, with the server addresses obtained from the setup guides, we evaluate the sever-side support for implicit and opportunistic TLS, as well as the characteristics of their certificates. Our results suggest that many users suffer from an inadvertent loss of security due to careless handling of TLS and auto-detect, and organizations in general are better off prescribing concrete and detailed manual configuration to their users.

TI  - A Large-Scale Measurement Study of the PROXY Protocol and its Security Implications
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-2247-paper.pdf
AB  - Reverse proxy servers play a critical role in optimizing Internet services, offering benefits ranging from load balancing to Denial of Service (DoS) protection. A known shortcoming of such proxies is that the backend server becomes oblivious to the IP address of the client who initiated the connection since all requests are forwarded by the proxy server. For HTTP, this issue is trivially solved by the X-Forwarded-For header, which allows the proxy server to pass to the backend server the IP address of the client that originated the request. Unfortunately, no such equivalent exists for many other protocols. To solve this issue, HAProxy created the PROXY protocol, which communicates client information from a proxy server to a backend server at a lower level in the network stack (Layer 4), making it protocol-agnostic.
In this work, we are the first to study the use of the PROXY protocol at Internet scale and investigate the security impact of its misconfigurations. We launched a measurement study on the full IPv4 address range and found that, over HTTP, more than 170,000 hosts accept PROXY protocol data from arbitrary sources. We demonstrate how to abuse this protocol to bypass on-path proxies (and their protections) and leak sensitive information from backend infrastructures. We discovered over 10,000 servers that are vulnerable to an access bypass, triggered by injecting a (spoofed) PROXY protocol header. Using this technique, we obtained access to over 500 internal servers providing control over IoT monitoring platforms and smart home automation devices, allowing us to, for example, regulate remote controlled window blinds or control security cameras and alarm systems. Beyond HTTP, we demonstrate how the PROXY protocol can be used to turn over 350 SMTP servers into open relays, enabling an attacker to send arbitrary emails from any email address. In sum, our study exposes how PROXY protocol misconfigurations lead to severe security issues that affect multiple protocols prominently used in the wild.

AB  - Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) have been widely adopted as a protection approach for security-critical applications. Although feature extensions have been previously proposed to improve the usability of enclaves, their provision patterns are still confronted with security challenges. This paper presents Palantir, a verifiable multi-layered inter-enclave privilege model for secure feature extensions to enclaves. Specifically, a parent-children inter-enclave relationship, with which a parent enclave is granted two privileged permissions, the Execution Control and Spatial Control, over its children enclaves to facilitate secure feature extensions, is introduced. Moreover, by enabling nesting parent-children relationships, Palantir achieves multi-layered privileges (MLP) that allow feature extensions to be placed in various privilege layers following the Principle of Least Privilege. To prove the security of Palantir, we verified that our privilege model does not break or weaken the security guarantees of enclaves by building and verifying a formal model named $text{TAP}^{infty}$. Furthermore, We implemented a prototype of Palantir on Penglai, an open-sourced RISC-V TEE platform. The evaluation demonstrates the promising performance of Palantir in runtime overhead $(<5%)$ and startup latencies.

T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-330-paper.pdf
AB  - The bootloader plays an important role during the boot process, as it connects two crucial components: the firmware and the operating system. After powering on, the bootloader takes control from the firmware, prepares the early boot environment, and then hands control over to the operating system. Modern computers often use a feature called secure boot to prevent malicious software from loading at startup. As a key part of the secure boot chain, the bootloader is responsible for verifying the operating system, loading its image into memory, and launching it. Therefore, the bootloader must be designed and implemented in a secure manner. However, bootloaders have increasingly provided more features and functionalities for end users. As the code base grows, bootloaders inevitably expose more attack surfaces. In recent years, vulnerabilities, particularly memory safety violations, have been discovered in various bootloaders. Some of these vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service or even bypass secure boot protections. Despite the bootloader’s critical role in the secure boot chain, a comprehensive memory safety analysis of bootloaders has yet to be conducted. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive and systematic memory safety analysis of bootloaders, based on a survey of previous bootloader vulnerabilities. We examine the potential attack surfaces of various bootloaders and how these surfaces lead to vulnerabilities. We observe that malicious input from peripherals such as storage devices and networks is a primary method attackers use to exploit bootloader vulnerabilities. To assist bootloader developers in detecting vulnerabilities at scale, we designed and implemented a bootloader fuzzing framework based on our analysis. In our experiments, we discovered 39 vulnerabilities in nine bootloaders, of which 38 are new vulnerabilities. In particular, 14 vulnerabilities were found in the widely used Linux standard bootloader GRUB, some of which can even lead to secure boot bypass if properly exploited. So far, five CVEs have been assigned to our findings.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-595-paper.pdf
AB  - Boards are increasingly required to oversee the cybersecurity risks of their organizations. To make informed decisions, board members have to rely on the information given to them, which could come from their Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), the reports of executives, audits, and regulations.
However, little is known about how boards decide after receiving such information and how their relationship with other stakeholders shapes those decisions. Here, we present the results of an in-depth interview study with n=18 C-level managers, board members, CISOs, and C-level consultants of some of the largest UK-based companies.
Our findings suggest that a power imbalance exists: board members will often not ask the right questions to executives and CISOs since they fear being exposed as IT novices. This ultimately makes boards highly dependent on those providing them with cybersecurity information, leading to losing their oversight function. Furthermore, cybersecurity risk is abstracted to budget decisions with no further involvement in cybersecurity strategies through boards.
We discuss possible ways to strengthen boards' oversight functions, such as releasing industry benchmarks through public cyber agencies or implementing support structures within the company - such as standing (cybersecurity) risk and audit committees.

AB  - Risk-based authentication (RBA) is gaining popularity and RBA notifications promptly alert users to protect their accounts from unauthorized access. Recent research indicates that users can identify legitimate login notifications triggered by themselves. However, little attention has been paid to whether RBA notifications triggered by non-account holders can effectively raise users' awareness of crises and prevent potential attacks. In this paper, we invite 258 online participants and 15 offline participants to explore users' perceptions, reactions, and expectations for three types of RBA notifications (i.e., RBA notifications triggered by correct passwords, incorrect passwords, and password resets).

AB  - Node.js and its ecosystem npm are notoriously insecure, enabling the proliferation of supply chain attacks. Deno is an emerging runtime that promises to offer a safer alternative for running untrusted JavaScript code outside of the browser. Learning from Node.js’s mistakes, Deno is written in Rust, a memory-safe programming language, and it includes a strict permission system that checks all accesses to sensitive APIs via static or runtime permissions. Deno also allows the inclusion of third-party code via URLs, which promises a more transparent way of handling dependencies, advocating for a fully decentralized software supply chain. In this paper, we study if Deno delivers on its promise of increased security. We find that indeed Deno has a smaller attack surface than Node.js, but there still are known attacks that are not addressed (ReDoS) or only partially mitigated (prototype pollution). Moreover, we find several weaknesses in Deno’s permission system, which allow sophisticated supply chain attacks. First, coarse-grained permissions allow attackers to abuse the ambient authority of the operating system to sidestep the permission system. Second, we find that URL imports are exempted from the permission checks, allowing attackers to perform unlawful network requests. We also identify time-of-check to time-of-use issues when handling symbolic links, making fine-grained file system access control ineffective. We then perform an empirical study of Deno’s main ecosystem deno.land to understand how developers consume third-party code and how permissions are used and communicated. We identify classical URL-related issues such as expired domains and reliance on insecure transport protocols, but we also find that it is challenging to guarantee uniform immutability and version control when multiple domains are involved in code distribution. We also provide initial evidence that developers poorly document required permissions on deno.land and that they tend to abuse coarse-grained permissions, reducing the benefits of the permission system. Our findings resulted in two security advisories for Deno and a redesign of its import mechanism. We also make concrete recommendations for improving Deno’s security model to further prevent supply chain attacks: add import permissions, additional access control at file system level, support for compartmentalization, and a manifest file that persists fine-grained permissions.

AB  - The advancement of trusted execution environments (TEEs) has enabled the confidential computing paradigm and created new application scenarios for WebAssembly (Wasm). "Wasm+TEE" designs achieve in-enclave multi-tenancy with strong isolation, facilitating concurrent execution of untrusted code instances from multiple users. However, the linear memory model of Wasm lacks efficient cross-module data sharing and fine-grained memory access control, significantly restricting its applications in certain confidential computing scenarios where secure data sharing is essential (e.g., confidential stateful FaaS and data marketplaces). In this paper, we propose WAVEN (WebAssembly Memory Virtualization for ENclaves), a novel WebAssembly memory virtualization scheme, to enable memory sharing among Wasm modules and page-level access control. We implement WAVEN atop WAMR, a popular Wasm runtime for TEEs, and empirically demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first approach that enables cross-module memory sharing with fine-grained memory access control in Wasm.

AB  - Vendors are often provided with updated versions of a piece of software, fixing known security issues.
However, the inability to have any guarantee that the provided patched software does not break the functionality of its original version often hinders patch deployment.
This issue is particularly severe when the patched software is only provided in its compiled binary form.
In this case, manual analysis of the patch's source code is impossible, and existing automated patch analysis techniques, which rely on source code, are not applicable.
Even when the source code is accessible, the necessity of binary-level patch verification is still crucial, as highlighted by the recent XZ Utils backdoor.

AB  - Super apps, serving as centralized platforms that manage user information and integrate third-party miniapps, have revolutionized mobile computing but also introduced significant security risks from malicious miniapps. Despite the mandatory miniapp vetting enforced to the built-in miniapp store, the threat of evolving miniapp malware persists, engaging in a continual cat-and-mouse game with platform security measures. However, compared with traditional paradigms such as mobile and web computing, there has been a lack of miniapp malware dataset available for the community to explore, hindering the generation of crucial insights and the development of robust detection techniques. In response to this, this paper addresses the scarcely explored territory of malicious miniapp analysis, dedicating  over three year to identifying, dissecting, and examining the risks posed by these miniapps, resulting in the first miniapp malware dataset now available to aid future studies to enhance the security of super app ecosystems.

PY  - 2025

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-331-paper.pdf
AB  - Machine learning has revolutionized numerous domains, playing a crucial role in driving advancements and enabling data-centric processes. The significance of data in training models and shaping their performance cannot be overstated. Recent research has highlighted the heterogeneous impact of individual data samples, particularly the presence of valuable data that significantly contributes to the utility and effectiveness of machine learning models. However, a critical question remains unanswered: are these valuable data samples more vulnerable to machine learning attacks? In this work, we investigate the relationship between data importance and machine learning attacks by analyzing five distinct attack types. Our findings reveal notable insights. For example, we observe that high importance data samples exhibit increased vulnerability in certain attacks, such as membership inference and model stealing. These findings also carry practical implications, inspiring researchers to design more efficient attacks. By analyzing the linkage between membership inference vulnerability and data importance, we demonstrate that sample characteristics can be integrated into membership metrics by introducing sample-specific criteria, therefore enhancing the membership inference performance. These findings emphasize the urgent need for innovative defense mechanisms that strike a balance between maximizing utility and safeguarding valuable data against potential exploitation.

TI  - type++: Prohibiting Type Confusion with Inline Type Information
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-53-paper.pdf
AB  - Type confusion, or bad casting, is a common C++ attack vector. Such vulnerabilities cause a program to interpret an object as belonging to a different type, enabling powerful attacks, like control-flow hijacking. C++ limits runtime checks to polymorphic classes because only those have inline type information. The lack of runtime type information throughout an object’s lifetime makes it challenging to enforce continuous checks and thereby prevent type confusion during downcasting. Current solutions either record type information for all objects disjointly, incurring prohibitive runtime overhead, or restrict protection to a fraction of all objects.
Our C++ dialect, type++, enforces the paradigm that each allocated object involved in downcasting carries type information throughout its lifetime, ensuring correctness by enabling type checks wherever and whenever necessary. As not just polymorphic objects but all objects are typed, all down-to casts can now be dynamically verified. Compared to existing solutions, our strategy greatly reduces runtime cost and enables type++ usage both during testing and as mitigation. Targeting SPEC CPU2006 and CPU2017, we compile and run 2,040 kLoC, while changing only 314 LoC. To help developers, our static analysis warns where code changes in target programs may be necessary. Running the compiled benchmarks results in negligible performance overhead (1.19% on SPEC CPU2006 and 0.82% on SPEC CPU2017) verifying a total of 90B casts (compared to 3.8B for the state-of-the-art, a 23× improvement). type++ discovers 122 type confusion issues in the SPEC CPU benchmarks among which 62 are new. Targeting Chromium, we change 229 LoC out of 35 MLoC to protect 94.6% of the classes that could be involved in downcasting vulnerabilities, while incurring only 0.98% runtime overhead compared to the baseline.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-139-paper.pdf
AB  - Twitter is recognized as a crucial platform for the dissemination and gathering of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). Its capability to provide real-time, actionable intelligence makes it a indispensable tool for detecting security events, helping security professionals cope with ever-growing threats. However, the large volume of tweets and inherent noises of human-crafted tweets pose significant challenges in accurately identifying security events. While many studies tried to filter out event-related tweets based on keywords, they are not effective due to their limitation in understanding the semantics of tweets. Another challenge in security event detection from Twitter is the comprehensive coverage of security events. Previous studies emphasized the importance of early detection of security events, but they overlooked the importance of event coverage. To cope with these challenges, in our study, we introduce a novel event attribution-centric tweet embedding method to enable the high precision and coverage of events. Our experiment result shows that the proposed method outperforms existing text and graph-based tweet embedding methods in identifying security events. Leveraging this novel embedding approach, we have developed and implemented a framework, textit{Tweezers}, that is applicable to security event detection from Twitter for CTI gathering. This framework has demonstrated its effectiveness, detecting twice as many events compared to established baselines. Additionally, we have showcased two applications, built on textit{Tweezers} for the integration and inspection of security events, i.e., security event trend analysis and informative security user identification.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-81-paper.pdf
AB  - Apple's App Privacy Report (``privacy report''), released in 2021, aims to
inform iOS users about apps' access to their data and sensors (e.g., contacts,
camera) and, unlike other privacy dashboards, what domains are contacted by apps and websites. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the privacy report, we conducted semi-structured interviews
(textit{n} = 20) to examine users' reactions to the information, their understanding of relevant privacy
implications, and how they might change
their behavior to address privacy concerns. Participants easily understood which
apps accessed data and sensors at certain times on their phones, and knew how to
remove an app's permissions in case of unexpected access. In contrast,
participants had difficulty understanding apps' and websites' network
activities. They were confused about how and why network activities occurred,
overwhelmed by the number of domains their apps contacted, and uncertain about
what remedial actions they could take against potential privacy threats. While
the privacy report and similar tools can increase transparency by presenting
users with details about how their data is handled, we recommend providing more
interpretation or aggregation of technical details, such as the purpose of
contacting domains, to help users make informed decisions.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-126-paper.pdf
AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent from experiences interacting with the environment. In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates TRAJDELETER, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of TRAJDELETER is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce TRAJAUDITOR, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether TRAJDELETER successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that TRAJDELETER requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available.

AB  - Code injection was a favored technique for attackers to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities decades ago. Subsequently, the widespread adoption of lightweight solutions like write-xor-execute (W⊕X) effectively mitigated most of these attacks by disallowing writable-and-executable memory. However, we observe multiple concerning cases where software developers accidentally disabled W⊕X and reintroduced executable stacks to popular applications. Although each violation has been properly fixed, a lingering question remains: what underlying factors contribute to these recurrent mistakes among developers, even in contemporary software development practices?

AB  - In this paper, we perform a multifaceted study on the security risk involved by the unique time-varying bottleneck links in emerging Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks (LSNs). We carry out our study in three steps. First, we profile the spatial and temporal characteristics of bottleneck links and how they might be exploited for bottleneck identification. Thus, the bottleneck links imposes a new risk of link flooding attack (LFA) on LSNs. Second, we propose SKYFALL, a new LFA risk analyzer that enables satellite network operators to simulate various LFA behaviors and comprehensively analyze the consequences on LSN services. Concretely, SKYFALL's analysis based on real-world information of operational LSNs demonstrates that the throughput of legal background traffic could be reduced by a factor of 3.4 if an attacker can manipulate a number of compromised user terminals  to continuously congest the bottleneck links. Based on our analysis, we finally discuss the limitations of traditional LFA countermeasures and propose new mitigation strategies for LSNs.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-450-paper.pdf
AB  - Personalization has become a crucial demand in the Generative AI technology. As the pre-trained generative model (*e.g.*, stable diffusion) has fixed and limited capability, it is desirable for users to customize the model to generate output with new or specific concepts. Fine-tuning the pre-trained model is not a promising solution, due to its high requirements of computation resources and data. Instead, the emerging personalization approaches make it feasible to augment the generative model in a lightweight manner. However, this also induces severe threats if such advanced techniques are misused by malicious users, such as spreading fake news or defaming individual reputations. Thus, it is necessary to regulate personalization models (*i.e.*, achieve *concept censorship*) for their development and advancement.

AB  - In recent years, the app-in-app paradigm, involving super-app and mini-app, has been becoming increasingly popular in the mobile ecosystem. Super-app platforms offer mini-app servers access to a suite of powerful and sensitive services, including payment processing and mini-app analytics. This access empowers mini-app servers to enhance their offerings with robust and practical functionalities and better serve their mini-apps. To safeguard these essential services, a credential-based authentication system has been implemented, facilitating secure access between super-app platforms and mini-app servers. However, the design and workflow of the crucial credential mechanism still remain unclear. More importantly, its security has not been comprehensively understood or explored to date.

While guidelines and recommendations exist on how to request permissions, developers have the creative freedom to design and phrase these rationales. In this work, we explore the characteristics of real-world rationales and how their building blocks affect users' permission decisions and their evaluation of those decisions. Through an analysis of 720 sentences and 428 screenshots of rationales from the top apps of Google Play, we identify the various phrasing and design elements of rationales. Subsequently, in a user study involving 960 participants, we explore how different combinations of phrasings impact users' permission decision-making process. By aligning our insights with established recommendations, we offer actionable guidelines for developers, aiming to make rationales a usable security instrument for users.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-s164-paper.pdf
AB  - Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity because of their comparable performance to proprietary LLMs. To efficiently fulfill domain-specialized tasks, open-source LLMs can be refined, without expensive accelerators, using low-rank adapters. However, it is still unknown whether low-rank adapters can be exploited to control LLMs. To address this gap, we demonstrate that an infected adapter can induce, on specific triggers, an LLM to output content defined by an adversary and to even maliciously use tools. To train a Trojan adapter, we propose two novel attacks, POLISHED and FUSION, that improve over prior approaches. POLISHED uses a superior LLM to align naïvely poisoned data based on our insight that it can better inject poisoning knowledge during training. In contrast, FUSION leverages a novel over-poisoning procedure to transform a benign adapter into a malicious one by magnifying the attention between trigger and target in model weights. In our experiments, we first conduct two case studies to demonstrate that a compromised LLM agent can use malware to control the system (e.g., a LLM-driven robot) or to launch a spear-phishing attack. Then, in terms of targeted misinformation, we show that our attacks provide higher attack effectiveness than the existing baseline and, for the purpose of attracting downloads, preserve or improve the adapter’s utility. Finally, we designed and evaluated three potential defenses. However, none proved entirely effective in safeguarding against our attacks, highlighting the need for more robust defenses supporting a secure LLM supply chain.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-816-paper.pdf
AB  - As the basis of software resource management (RM), strictly following the RM-API constraints guarantees secure resource management and software. To enhance the RM-API application, researchers find it effective in detecting RM-API misuse on open-source software according to RM-API constraints retrieved from documentation and code. However, the current pattern-matching constraint retrieval methods have limitations: the documentation-based methods leave many API constraints irregularly distributed or involving neutral sentiment undiscovered; the code-based methods result in many false bugs due to incorrect API usage since not all high-frequency usages are correct.
Therefore, people propose to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for RM-API constraint retrieval with their potential on text analysis and generation. However, directly using LLMs has limitations due to the hallucinations. The LLMs fabricate answers without expertise leaving many RM APIs undiscovered and generating incorrect answers even with evidence introducing incorrect RM-API constraints and false bugs.

T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-s277-paper.pdf
AB  - The widespread use of Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress has made these systems attractive targets for adversaries, with the vulnerabilities in the code posing serious risks. Despite being the most effective way to reduce these risks, more than half of all CMS installations lack the latest security patches. Researchers have tried to notify website operators about vulnerabilities using vulnerability notifications, which often exhibit limited impact. In this paper, we use the Grounded Theory approach to investigate the reasons why website owners do not update their CMS. To gain a holistic view on lacking update behavior, we interviewed website owners with outdated WordPress-based systems as well as individuals involved in website creation and hosting. On the one hand, we could confirm issues known from other ecosystems, such as lack of risk awareness, perceived risks of updates, and update costs, as factors for lacking CMS updates. More importantly, our study identified factors that have not been explicitly addressed in the general updating behaviour and vulnerability notification literature: (1) the subjective value of a website to its owner and (2) the delegation of website operations, which influence updating behavior far more decisively. Furthermore, we showed that website owners perceive a potential compromise of their CMS only as a risk to themselves and not as a threat to the wider online community. These findings that we present as four non-update scenarios may partly explain the limited success of previous efforts to notify operators about vulnerabilities in their systems. Our study not only offers valuable insights for future research, testing the effectiveness of vulnerability notifications and studying updating behavior in general, but it also proposes practical suggestions on how to reduce the number of outdated systems on the web.

TI  - Silence False Alarms: Identifying Anti-Reentrancy Patterns on Ethereum to Refine Smart Contract Reentrancy Detection
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-167-paper.pdf
AB  - Reentrancy vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts have caused significant financial losses, prompting the creation of several automated reentrancy detectors. However, these detectors frequently yield a high rate of false positives due to coarse detection rules, often misclassifying contracts protected by anti-reentrancy patterns as vulnerable. Thus, there is a critical need for the development of specialized automated tools to assist these detectors in accurately identifying anti-reentrancy patterns. While existing code analysis techniques show promise for this specific task, they still face significant challenges in recognizing anti-reentrancy patterns. These challenges are primarily due to the complex and varied features of anti-reentrancy patterns, compounded by insufficient prior knowledge about these features.

TI  - Secure IP Address Allocation at Cloud Scale
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-374-paper.pdf
AB  - Public clouds necessitate dynamic resource allocation and sharing. However, the dynamic allocation of IP addresses can be abused by adversaries to source malicious traffic, bypass rate limiting systems, and even capture traffic intended for other cloud tenants. As a result, both the cloud provider and their customers are put at risk, and defending against these threats requires a rigorous analysis of tenant behavior, adversarial strategies, and cloud provider policies. In this paper, we develop a practical defense for IP address allocation through such an analysis. We first develop a statistical model of cloud tenant deployment behavior based on literature and measurement of deployed systems. Through this, we analyze IP allocation policies under existing and novel threat models. In response to our stronger proposed threat model, we design IP scan segmentation, an IP allocation policy that protects the address pool against adversarial scanning even when an adversary is not limited by number of cloud tenants. Through empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real-world allocation traces, we show that IP scan segmentation reduces adversaries' ability to rapidly allocate addresses, protecting both address space reputation and cloud tenant data. In this way, we show that principled analysis and implementation of cloud IP address allocation can lead to substantial security gains for tenants and their users.

AB  - The number of vulnerabilities exploited in Arm TrustZone systems has been increasing recently. The absence of digital forensics tools prevents platform owners from incident response or periodic security scans. However, the area of secure forensics for compromised TrustZone remains unexplored and presents unresolved challenges. Traditional out-of-TrustZone forensics are inherently hindered by TrustZone protection, rendering them infeasible. In-TrustZone approaches are susceptible to attacks from privileged adversaries, undermining their security.

TI  - Revisiting Physical-World Adversarial Attack on Traffic Sign Recognition: A Commercial Systems Perspective
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-s90-paper.pdf
AB  - Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is crucial for safe and correct driving automation. Recent works revealed a general vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world adversarial attacks, which can be low-cost, highly deployable, and capable of causing severe attack effects such as hiding a critical traffic sign or spoofing a fake one. However, so far existing works generally only considered evaluating the attack effects on academic TSR models, leaving the impacts of such attacks on real-world commercial TSR systems largely unclear. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement of physical-world adversarial attacks against commercial TSR systems. Our testing results reveal that it is possible for existing attack works from academia to have highly reliable (100%) attack success against certain commercial TSR system functionality, but such attack capabilities are not generalizable, leading to much lower-than-expected attack success rates overall. We find that one potential major factor is a spatial memorization design that commonly exists in today's commercial TSR systems. We design new attack success metrics that can mathematically model the impacts of such design on the TSR system-level attack success, and use them to revisit existing attacks. Through these efforts, we uncover 7 novel observations, some of which directly challenge the observations or claims in prior works due to the introduction of the new metrics.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-549-paper.pdf
AB  - We present Rondo, a scalable and reconfiguration-friendly distributed randomness beacon (DRB) protocol in the partially synchronous model. Rondo is the first DRB protocol that is built from batched asynchronous verifiable secret sharing (bAVSS) and meanwhile avoids the high $O(n^3)$ message cost, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Our key contribution lies in the introduction of a new variant of bAVSS called batched asynchronous verifiable secret sharing with partial output (bAVSS-PO). bAVSS-PO is a weaker primitive than bAVSS but allows us to build a secure and more scalable DRB protocol. We propose a bAVSS-PO protocol Breeze. Breeze achieves the optimal $O(n)$ messages for the sharing stage and allows Rondo to offer better scalability than prior DRB protocols.
Additionally, to support the reconfiguration, we introduce Rondo-BFT, a dynamic and partially synchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol inspired by Dyno (S&P 2022). Unlike Dyno, Rondo-BFT provides a communication pattern that generates randomness beacon output periodically, making it well-suited for DRB applications.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-521-paper.pdf
AB  - This paper investigates the fundamental estimation problem in local differential privacy (LDP). We categorize existing estimation methods into two approaches, the unbiased estimation approach, which, under LDP, often gives unreasonable results (negative results or the sum of estimation does not equal to the total number of participating users), due to the excessive amount of noise added in LDP, and the maximal likelihood estimation (MLE)-based approach, which, can give reasonable results, but often suffers from the overfitting issue. To address this challenge, we propose a reduction framework inspired by Gaussian mixture models (GMM). We adapt the reduction framework to LDP estimation by transferring the estimation problem to the density estimation problem of the mixture model. Through the merging operation of the smallest weight component in this mixture model, the EM algorithm converges faster and produces a more robust distribution estimation. We show this framework offers a general and efficient way of modeling various LDP protocols. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of mean estimation, categorical distribution estimation, and numerical distribution estimation.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-80-paper.pdf
AB  - Machine unlearning refers to the process of mitigating the influence of specific training data on machine learning models based on removal requests from data owners. However, one important area that has been largely overlooked in the research of unlearning is reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning focuses on training an agent to make optimal decisions within an environment to maximize its cumulative rewards. During the training, the agent tends to memorize the features of the environment, which raises a significant concern about privacy. As per data protection regulations, the owner of the environment holds the right to revoke access to the agent's training data, thus necessitating the development of a novel and pressing research field, termed emph{reinforcement unlearning}. Reinforcement unlearning focuses on revoking entire environments rather than individual data samples. This unique characteristic presents three distinct challenges: 1) how to propose unlearning schemes for environments; 2) how to avoid degrading the agent's performance in remaining environments; and 3) how to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning. To tackle these challenges, we propose two reinforcement unlearning methods. The first method is based on decremental reinforcement learning, which aims to erase the agent's previously acquired knowledge gradually. The second method leverages environment poisoning attacks, which encourage the agent to learn new, albeit incorrect, knowledge to remove the unlearning environment. Particularly, to tackle the third challenge, we introduce the concept of ``environment inference'' to evaluate the unlearning outcomes.

TI  - ReDAN: An Empirical Study on Remote DoS Attacks against NAT Networks
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-972-paper.pdf
AB  - In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on remote DoS attacks targeting NAT networks (ReDAN, short for Remote DoS Attacks targeting NAT). We show that Internet attackers operating outside local NAT networks possess the capability to remotely identify a NAT device and subsequently terminate TCP connections initiated from the identified NAT device to external servers. Our attack involves two steps. First, we identify NAT devices on the Internet by exploiting inadequacies in the Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) mechanism within NAT specifications. This deficiency creates a fundamental side channel that allows Internet attackers to distinguish if a public IPv4 address serves a NAT device or a separate IP host, aiding in the identification of target NAT devices. Second, we launch a remote DoS attack to terminate TCP connections on the identified NAT devices. While recent NAT implementations may include protective measures, such as packet legitimacy validation to prevent malicious manipulations on NAT mappings, we discover that these safeguards are not widely adopted in real world. Consequently, attackers can send crafted packets to deceive NAT devices into erroneously removing innocent TCP connection mappings, thereby disrupting the NATed clients to access remote TCP servers. Our experimental results reveal widespread security vulnerabilities in existing NAT devices. After testing 8 types of router firmware and 30 commercial NAT devices from 14 vendors, we identify vulnerabilities in 6 firmware types and 29 NAT devices that allow off-path removal of TCP connection mappings. Moreover, our measurements reveal a stark reality: 166 out of 180 (over 92%) tested real-world NAT networks, comprising 90 4G LTE/5G networks, 60 public Wi-Fi networks, and 30 cloud VPS networks, are susceptible to exploitation. We responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to affected vendors and received a significant number of acknowledgments. Finally, we propose our countermeasures against the identified DoS attack.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-s322-paper.pdf
AB  - This paper aims to design and implement a radio device capable of detecting a person's handwriting through a wall. Although there is extensive research on radio frequency (RF) based human activity recognition, this task is particularly challenging due to the textit{through-wall} requirement and the textit{tiny-scale} handwriting movements. To address these challenges, we present RadSee---a 6 GHz frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system designed for detecting handwriting content behind a wall. RadSee is realized through a joint hardware and software design. On the hardware side, RadSee features a 6 GHz FMCW radar device equipped with two custom-designed, high-gain patch antennas. These two antennas provide a sufficient link power budget, allowing RadSee to "see'' through most walls with a small transmission power. On the software side, RadSee extracts effective phase features corresponding to the writer's hand movements and employs a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model with an attention mechanism to classify handwriting letters. As a result, RadSee can detect millimeter-level handwriting movements and recognize most letters based on their unique phase patterns. Additionally, it is resilient to interference from other moving objects and in-band radio devices. We have built a prototype of RadSee and evaluated its performance in various scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RadSee achieves 75% letter recognition accuracy when victims write 62 random letters, and 87% word recognition accuracy when they write articles.

TI  - ReThink: Reveal the Threat of Electromagnetic Interference on Power Inverters
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-691-paper.pdf
AB  - With the boom of renewable energy sources (RES), the number of power inverters proliferates. Power inverters are the key electronic devices that transform the direct current (DC) power from RES to the alternating current (AC) power on the grids, and their security can affect the stable operation of RES and even power grids. This paper analyzes the security of photovoltaic (PV) inverters from the aspects of internal sensors since they serve as the foundation for safe power conversion. We discover that both the embedded current sensors and voltage sensors are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference (EMI) of 1 GHz or higher, despite electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) countermeasures. Such vulnerabilities can lead to incorrect measurements and deceiving the control algorithms, and we design ReThink that could produce three types of consequences on PV inverters by emitting carefully crafted EMI, i.e., Denial of Service (DoS), damaging inverters physically or damping the power output. We successfully validate these consequences on 5 off-the-shelf PV inverters, and even in a real-world microgrid, by transmitting EMI signals at a distance of 100 ∼ 150cm and a total power within 20W. Our work aims to raise awareness of the security of power electronic devices of RES, as they represent an emerging Cyber-Physical attack surface to the future RES-dominated grid. Finally, to cope with such threats, we provide hardware and software-based countermeasures.

AB  - Malicious shell commands are linchpins to many cyber-attacks, but may not be easy to understand by security analysts due to complicated and often disguised code structures. Advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked the possibility of generating understandable explanations for shell commands. However, existing general-purpose LLMs suffer from a lack of expert knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate in the task of shell command explanation. In this paper, we present Raconteur, a knowledgeable, expressive and portable shell command explainer powered by LLM. Raconteur is infused with professional knowledge to provide comprehensive explanations on shell commands, including not only what the command does (i.e., behavior) but also why the command does it (i.e., purpose). To shed light on the high-level intent of the command, we also translate the natural-language-based explanation into standard technique & tactic defined by MITRE ATT&CK, the worldwide knowledge base of cybersecurity. To enable Raconteur to explain unseen private commands, we further develop a documentation retriever to obtain relevant information from complementary documentations to assist the explanation process. We have created a large-scale dataset for training and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the capability of Raconteur in shell command explanation. The experiments verify that Raconteur is able to provide high-quality explanations and in-depth insight of the intent of the command.

TI  - PowerRadio: Manipulate Sensor Measurement via Power GND Radiation
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-295-paper.pdf
AB  - Sensors are key components to enable various applications, e.g., home intrusion detection, and environment monitoring. While various software defenses and physical protections are used to prevent sensor manipulation, this paper introduces a new threat vector, PowerRadio, which can bypass existing protections and change the sensor readings at a distance. PowerRadio leverages interconnected ground (GND) wires, a standard practice for electrical safety at home, to inject malicious signals. The injected signal is coupled by the sensor's analog measurement wire and eventually, it survives the noise filters, inducing incorrect measurement. We present three methods that can manipulate sensors by inducing static bias, periodical signals, or pulses. For instance, we show adding stripes into the captured images of a surveillance camera or injecting inaudible voice commands into conference microphones. We study the underlying principles of PowerRadio and find its root causes: (1) the lack of shielding between ground and data signal wires and (2) the asymmetry of circuit impedance that enables interference to bypass filtering. We validate PowerRadio against a surveillance system, broadcast system, and various sensors. We believe that PowerRadio represents an emerging threat that exhibits the pros of both radiated and conducted EMI, e.g., expanding the effective attack distance of radiated EMI yet eliminating the requirement of line-of-sight or approaching physically. Our insights shall provide guidance for enhancing the sensors' security and power wiring during the design phases.

PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-997-paper.pdf
AB  - LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a pivotal sensor for autonomous driving, offering precise 3D spatial information.
Previous signal attacks against LiDAR systems mainly exploit laser signals. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of cross-modality signal injection attacks, i.e., injecting intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) to manipulate LiDAR output. Our insight is that the internal modules of a LiDAR, i.e., the laser receiving circuit, the monitoring sensors, and the beam-steering modules, even with strict electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, can still couple with the IEMI attack signals and result in the malfunction of LiDAR systems. Based on the above attack surfaces, we propose the alias attack, which manipulates LiDAR output in terms of textit{Points Interference}, textit{Points Injection}, textit{Points Removal}, and even textit{LiDAR Power-Off}.
We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of alias with both simulated and real-world experiments on five COTS LiDAR systems.
We also conduct feasibility experiments in real-world moving scenarios.
We provide potential defense measures that can be implemented at both the sensor level and the vehicle system level to mitigate the risks associated with IEMI attacks.

T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-30-paper.pdf
AB  - Split Learning (SL) has emerged as a practical and efficient alternative to traditional federated learning. While previous attempts to attack SL have often relied on overly strong assumptions or targeted easily exploitable models, we seek to develop more capable attacks. We introduce SDAR, a novel attack framework against SL with an honest-but-curious server. SDAR leverages auxiliary data and adversarial regularization to learn a decodable simulator of the client's private model, which can effectively infer the client's private features under the vanilla SL, and both features and labels under the U-shaped SL. We perform extensive experiments in both configurations to validate the effectiveness of our proposed attacks. Notably, in challenging scenarios where existing passive attacks struggle to reconstruct the client's private data effectively, SDAR consistently achieves significantly superior attack performance, even comparable to active attacks. On CIFAR-10, at the deep split level of 7, SDAR achieves private feature reconstruction with less than 0.025 mean squared error in both the vanilla and the U-shaped SL, and attains a label inference accuracy of over 98% in the U-shaped setting, while existing attacks fail to produce non-trivial results.

TI  - On the Realism of LiDAR Spoofing Attacks against Autonomous Driving Vehicle at High Speed and Long Distance
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-628-paper.pdf
AB  - The rapid deployment of Autonomous Driving (AD) technologies on public roads presents significant social challenges. The security of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is one of the emerging challenges in AD deployment, given its crucial role in enabling Level 4 autonomy through accurate 3D environmental sensing. Recent lines of research have demonstrated that LiDAR can be compromised by LiDAR spoofing attacks that overwrite legitimate sensing by emitting malicious lasers to the LiDAR. However, previous studies have successfully demonstrated their attacks in controlled environments, yet gaps exist in the feasibility of their attacks in realistic high-speed, long-distance AD scenarios. To bridge these gaps, we design a novel Moving Vehicle Spoofing (MVS) system consisting of 3 subsystems: the LiDAR detection and tracking system, the auto-aiming system, and the LiDAR spoofing system. Furthermore, we design a new object removal attack, an adaptive high-frequency removal (A-HFR) attack, that can be effective even against recent LiDARs with pulse fingerprinting features, by leveraging gray-box knowledge of the scan timing of target LiDARs. With our MVS system, we are not only the first to demonstrate LiDAR spoofing attacks against practical AD scenarios where the victim vehicle is driving at high speeds (60 km/h) and the attack is launched from long distances (110 meters), but we are also the first to perform LiDAR spoofing attacks against a vehicle actually operated by a popular AD stack. Our object removal attack achieves ≥96% attack success rates against the vehicle driving at 60 km/h to the braking distances (20 meters). Finally, we discuss possible countermeasures against attacks with our MVS system. This study not only bridges critical gaps between LiDAR security and AD security research but also sets a foundation for developing robust countermeasures against emerging threats.

TI  - Off-Path TCP Hijacking in Wi-Fi Networks: A Packet-Size Side Channel Attack
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-305-paper.pdf
AB  - In this paper, we unveil a fundamental side channel in Wi-Fi networks, specifically the observable frame size, which can be exploited by attackers to conduct TCP hijacking attacks.
Despite the various security mechanisms (e.g., WEP and WPA2/WPA3) implemented to safeguard Wi-Fi networks, our study reveals that an off-path attacker can still extract sufficient information from the frame size side channel to hijack the victim's TCP connection.
Our side channel attack is based on two significant findings: (i) response packets (e.g., ACK and RST) generated by TCP receivers vary in size, and (ii) the encrypted frames containing these response packets have consistent and distinguishable sizes.
By observing the size of the victim's encrypted frames, the attacker can detect and hijack the victim's TCP connections.
We validate the effectiveness of this side channel attack through two case studies, i.e., SSH DoS and web traffic manipulation.
Precisely, our attack can terminate the victim's SSH session in 19 seconds and inject malicious data into the victim's web traffic within 28 seconds.
Furthermore, we conduct extensive measurements to evaluate the impact of our attack on real-world Wi-Fi networks. We test 30 popular wireless routers from 9 well-known vendors, and none of these routers can protect victims from our attack. Besides, we implement our attack in 80 real-world Wi-Fi networks and successfully hijack the victim's TCP connections in 75 (93.75%) evaluated Wi-Fi networks.
We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to the Wi-Fi Alliance and proposed several mitigation strategies to address this issue.

AB  - Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become an indispensable part of modern computing infrastructure. They can execute massively parallel tasks on large data sets and have rich user space-accessible APIs for 3D rendering and general-purpose parallel programming. Unfortunately, the GPU drivers that bridge the gap between these APIs and the underlying hardware have grown increasingly large and complex over the years. Many GPU drivers now expose broad attack surfaces and pose serious security risks.

TI  - MineShark: Cryptomining Traffic Detection at Scale
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-402-paper.pdf
AB  - The rapid growth of cryptojacking and the increase in regulatory bans on cryptomining have prompted organizations to enhance detection ability within their networks. Traditional methods, including rule-based detection and deep packet inspection, fall short in timely and comprehensively identifying new and encrypted mining threats. In contrast, learning-based techniques show promise by identifying content-agnostic traffic patterns, adapting to a wide range of cryptomining configurations. However, existing learning-based systems often lack scalability in real-world detection, primarily due to challenges with unlabeled, imbalanced, and high-speed traffic inputs. To address these issues, we introduce MineShark, a system that identifies robust patterns of mining traffic to distinguish between vast quantities of benign traffic and automates the confirmation of model outcomes through active probing to prevent an overload of model alarms. As model inference labels are progressively confirmed, MineShark conducts self-improving updates to enhance model accuracy. MineShark is capable of line-rate detection at various traffic volume scales with the allocation of different amounts of CPU and GPU resources. In a 10 Gbps campus network deployment lasting ten months, MineShark detected cryptomining connections toward 105 mining pools ahead of concurrently deployed commercial systems, 17.6% of which were encrypted. It automatically filtered over 99.3% of false alarms and achieved an average packet processing throughput of 1.3 Mpps, meeting the line-rate demands of a 10 Gbps network, with a negligible loss rate of 0.2%. We publicize MineShark for broader use.

As image contents are unknown prior analysis, it is hard to select textit{high-quality} samples that can satisfy scientific demands.
Ideally, we help each other out by sharing data. But here, sharing is problematic due to copyright laws. Instead, papers must carefully document each step of corpus creation: If a step is unclear, replicability is jeopardized. This has cascading effects on result verifiability, representativeness, and, thus, soundness.

TI  - Manifoldchain: Maximizing Blockchain Throughput via Bandwidth-Clustered Sharding
PY  - 2025
T2  - NDSS 2025
UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-28-paper.pdf
AB  - Bandwidth limitation is the major bottleneck that hinders scaling throughput of proof-of-work blockchains. To guarantee security, the mining rate of the blockchain is determined by the miners with the lowest bandwidth, resulting in an inefficient bandwidth utilization among fast miners. We propose Manifoldchain, an innovative blockchain sharding protocol that alleviates the impact of slow miners to maximize blockchain throughput. Manifoldchain utilizes a bandwidth-clustered shard formation mechanism that groups miners with similar bandwidths into the same shard. Consequently, this approach enables us to set an optimal mining rate for each shard based on its bandwidth, effectively reducing the waiting time caused by slow miners. Nevertheless, the adversary could corrupt miners with similar bandwidths, thereby concentrating hashing power and potentially creating an adversarial majority within a single shard. To counter this adversarial strategy, we introduce textit{sharing mining}, allowing the honest mining power of the entire network to participate in the secure ledger formation of each shard, thereby achieving the same level of security as an unsharded blockchain. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous atomic commitment mechanism to ensure transaction atomicity across shards with various mining rates. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Manifoldchain scales linearly in throughput with the increase in shard numbers and inversely with network delay in each shard. We implement a full system prototype of Manifoldchain, comprehensively evaluated on both simulated and real-world testbeds. These experiments validate its vertical scalability with network bandwidth and horizontal scalability with network size, achieving a substantial improvement of 186% in throughput over baseline sharding protocols, for scenarios where bandwidths of miners range from 5Mbps to 60Mbps.

AB  - Intents are the primary message-passing mechanism on Android, used for both communication between intra-app and inter-app components. Intents go across the trust boundary of applications and can break the security isolation between them. Due to their shared API with intra-app communication, apps may unintentionally expose functionality leading to important security bugs. MALintent is an open-source fuzzing framework that uses novel coverage instrumentation techniques and customizable bug oracles to find security issues in Android Intent handlers. MALintent is the first Intent fuzzer that applies greybox fuzzing on compiled closed-source Android applications. We demonstrate techniques widely compatible with many versions of Android and our bug oracles were able to find several crashes, vulnerabilities with privacy implications, and memory-safety issues in the top-downloaded Android applications on the Google Play store.

AB  - Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been increasingly popular in privacy-preserving applications and blockchain systems. To facilitate handy and efficient ZK proof generation for normal users, the industry has designed domain-specific languages (DSLs) and ZK compilers. Given a program in ZK DSL, a ZK compiler compiles it into a circuit, which is then passed to the prover and verifier for ZK checking. However, the correctness of ZK compilers is not well studied, and recent works have shown that de facto ZK compilers are buggy, which can allow malicious users to generate invalid proofs that are accepted by the verifier, causing security breaches and financial losses in cryptocurrency.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) has been instrumental in enabling joint transceiver optimization by merging all physical layer blocks of the end-to-end wireless communication systems. Although there have been a number of adversarial attacks on ML-based wireless systems, the existing methods do not provide a comprehensive view including multi-modality of the source data, common physical layer protocols, and wireless domain constraints. This paper proposes Magmaw, a novel wireless attack methodology capable of generating universal adversarial perturbations for any multimodal signal transmitted over a wireless channel. We further introduce new objectives for adversarial attacks on downstream applications. We adopt the widely used defenses to verify the resilience of Magmaw. For proof-of-concept evaluation, we build a real-time wireless attack platform using a software-defined radio system. Experimental results demonstrate that Magmaw causes significant performance degradation even in the presence of strong defense mechanisms. Furthermore, we validate the performance of Magmaw in two case studies: encrypted communication channel and channel modality-based ML model. Our code is available at https://github.com/juc023/Magmaw.

AB  - As the use of language-level sandboxing for running untrusted code grows, the risks associated with memory disclosure vulnerabilities and transient execution attacks become increasingly significant. Besides the execution of untrusted JavaScript or WebAssembly code in web browsers, serverless environments have also started relying on language-level isolation to improve scalability by running multiple functions from different customers within a single process. Web browsers have adopted process-level sandboxing to mitigate memory leakage attacks, but this solution is not applicable in serverless environments, as running each function as a separate process would negate the performance benefits of language-level isolation.

UR  - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-822-paper.pdf
AB  - As cyber attacks grow increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, it becomes more imperative and challenging to detect intrusion from normal behaviors. Through fine-grained causality analysis, provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDS) demonstrated a promising capacity to distinguish benign and malicious behaviors, attracting widespread attention from both industry and academia. Among diverse approaches, rule-based PIDS stands out due to its lightweight overhead, real-time capabilities, and explainability. However, existing rule-based systems suffer low detection accuracy, especially the high false alarms, due to the lack of fine-grained rules and environment-specific configurations.
In this paper, we propose CAPTAIN, a rule-based PIDS capable of automatically adapting to diverse environments. Specifically, we propose three adaptive parameters to adjust the detection configuration with respect to nodes, edges, and alarm generation thresholds. We build a differentiable tag propagation framework and utilize the gradient descent algorithm to optimize these adaptive parameters based on the training data. We evaluate our system using data from DARPA Engagements and simulated environments. The evaluation results demonstrate that CAPTAIN enhances rule-based PIDS with learning capabilities, resulting in improved detection accuracy, reduced detection latency, lower runtime overhead, and more interpretable detection procedures and results compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) PIDS.

Even more concerning, existing rebalancing protocol solutions heavily rely on trust assumptions and scripting languages, resulting in compromised universality and reliability.

AB  - Large transformer-based models have realized state-of-the-art performance on lots of real-world tasks such as natural language processing and computer vision.
However, with the increasing sensitivity of the data and tasks they handle, privacy has become a major concern during model deployment.
In this work, we focus on private inference in two-party settings, where one party holds private inputs and the other holds the model.
We introduce BumbleBee, a fast and communication-friendly two-party private transformer inference system.
Our contributions are three-fold:
First, we propose optimized protocols for matrix multiplication, which significantly reduce communication costs by 80% -- 90% compared to previous techniques.
Secondly, we develop a methodology for constructing efficient protocols tailored to the non-linear activation functions employed in transformer models.
The proposed activation protocols have realized a significant enhancement in processing speed, alongside a remarkable reduction in communication costs by 80% -- 95% compared with two prior methods.
Lastly, we have performed extensive benchmarks on five transformer models.
BumbleBee demonstrates its capability by evaluating the LLaMA-7B model, generating one token in approximately 8 minutes using CPUs.
Our results further reveal that BumbleBee outperforms Iron (NeurIPS22) by over an order of magnitude and is three times faster than BOLT (Oakland24) with one-tenth communication.

Moreover, with the release of high-quality pre-trained image-generative models, a growing number of users are downloading these pre-trained models to fine-tune them with downstream datasets for various image-generation tasks. However, employing such powerful pre-trained models in downstream tasks presents significant privacy leakage risks. In this paper, we propose the first scores-based membership inference attack framework tailored for recent diffusion models, and in the more stringent black-box access setting. Considering four distinct attack scenarios and three types of attacks, this framework is capable of targeting any popular conditional generator model, achieving high precision, evidenced by an impressive AUC of 0.95.

AB  - In privacy compliance research, a significant challenge lies in comparing specific data items in actual data usage practices with the privacy data defined in laws, regulations, or policies. This task is complex due to the diversity of data items used by various applications, as well as the different interpretations of privacy data across jurisdictions. To address this challenge, privacy data taxonomies have been constructed to capture relationships between privacy data types and granularity levels, facilitating privacy compliance analysis. However, existing taxonomy construction approaches are limited by manual efforts or heuristic rules, hindering their ability to incorporate new terms from diverse domains. In this paper, we present the design of GRASP, a scalable and efficient methodology for automatically constructing and expanding privacy data taxonomies. GRASP incorporates a novel hypernym prediction model based on granularity-aware semantic projection, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art hypernym prediction methods. Additionally, we design and implement Tracy, a privacy professional assistant to recognize and interpret private data in incident reports for GDPR-compliant data breach notification. We evaluate Tracy in a usability study with 15 privacy professionals, yielding high-level usability and satisfaction.

AB  - Microsoft Office is a comprehensive suite of productivity tools and Object Linking & Embedding (OLE) is a specification that standardizes the linking and embedding of a diverse set of objects across different applications.OLE facilitates data interchange and streamlines user experience when dealing with composite documents (e.g., an embedded Excel sheet in a Word document). However, inherent security weaknesses within the design of OLE present risks, as the design of OLE inherently blurs the trust boundary between first-party and third-party code, which may lead to unintended library loading and parsing vulnerabilities which could be exploited by malicious actors. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces OLExplore, a novel tool designed for security assessment of Office OLE objects.With an in-depth examination of historical OLE vulnerabilities, we have identified three key categories of vulnerabilities and subjected them to dynamic analysis and verification. Our evaluation of various Windows operating system versions has led to the discovery of 26 confirmed vulnerabilities, with 17 assigned CVE numbers that all have remote code execution potential.

AB  - Traditional black-box adversarial attacks on computer vision models face significant limitations, including intensive querying requirements, time-consuming iterative processes, a lack of universality, and low attack success rates (ASR) and confidence levels (CL) due to subtle perturbations. This paper introduces AlphaDog, an Alpha channel attack, the first universally efficient targeted no-box attack, exploiting the often overlooked Alpha channel in RGBA images to create visual disparities between human perception and machine interpretation, efficiently deceiving both. Specifically, AlphaDog maliciously sets the RGB channels to represent the desired object for AI recognition, while crafting the Alpha channel to create a different perception for humans when blended with a standard or default background color of digital media (thumbnail or image viewer apps). Leveraging differences in how AI models and human vision process transparency, AlphaDog outperforms existing adversarial attacks in four key ways: (i) as a no-box attack, it requires zero queries; (ii) it achieves highly efficient generation, taking milliseconds to produce arbitrary attack images; (iii) AlphaDog can be universally applied, compromising most AI models with a single attack image; (iv) it guarantees 100% ASR and CL. The assessment of 6,500 AlphaDog attack examples across 100 state-of-the-art image recognition systems demonstrates AlphaDog's effectiveness, and an IRB-approved experiment involving 20 college-age participants validates AlphaDog's stealthiness. AlphaDog can be applied in data poisoning, evasion attacks, and content moderation. Additionally, a novel pixel-intensity histogram-based detection method is introduced to identify AlphaDog, achieving 100% effectiveness in detecting and protecting computer vision models against AlphaDog. Demos are available on the AlphaDog website (https://sites.google.com/view/alphachannelattack/home).

AB  - Modern machine learning (ML) ecosystems offer a surging number of ML frameworks and code repositories that can greatly facilitate the development of ML models. Today, even ordinary data holders who are not ML experts can apply off-the-shelf codebase to build high-performance ML models on their data, many of which are sensitive in nature (e.g., clinical records).
